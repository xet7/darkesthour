16.10 Defining Jump Instruction Patterns
========================================

For most machines, GNU CC assumes that the machine has a condition code.
A comparison insn sets the condition code, recording the results of both
signed and unsigned comparison of the given operands.  A separate branch
insn tests the condition code and branches or not according its value.
The branch insns come in distinct signed and unsigned flavors.  Many
common machines, such as the Vax, the 68000 and the 32000, work this
way.

   Some machines have distinct signed and unsigned compare
instructions, and only one set of conditional branch instructions.  The
easiest way to handle these machines is to treat them just like the
others until the final stage where assembly code is written.  At this
time, when outputting code for the compare instruction, peek ahead at
the following branch using `next_cc0_user (insn)'.  (The variable
`insn' refers to the insn being output, in the output-writing code in
an instruction pattern.)  If the RTL says that is an unsigned branch,
output an unsigned compare; otherwise output a signed compare.  When
the branch itself is output, you can treat signed and unsigned branches
identically.

   The reason you can do this is that GNU CC always generates a pair of
consecutive RTL insns, possibly separated by `note' insns, one to set
the condition code and one to test it, and keeps the pair inviolate
until the end.

   To go with this technique, you must define the machine-description
macro `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' to do `CC_STATUS_INIT'; in other words, no
compare instruction is superfluous.

   Some machines have compare-and-branch instructions and no condition
code.  A similar technique works for them.  When it is time to "output"
a compare instruction, record its operands in two static variables.
When outputting the branch-on-condition-code instruction that follows,
actually output a compare-and-branch instruction that uses the
remembered operands.

   It also works to define patterns for compare-and-branch instructions.
In optimizing compilation, the pair of compare and branch instructions
will be combined according to these patterns.  But this does not happen
if optimization is not requested.  So you must use one of the solutions
above in addition to any special patterns you define.

   In many RISC machines, most instructions do not affect the condition
code and there may not even be a separate condition code register.  On
these machines, the restriction that the definition and use of the
condition code be adjacent insns is not necessary and can prevent
important optimizations.  For example, on the IBM RS/6000, there is a
delay for taken branches unless the condition code register is set three
instructions earlier than the conditional branch.  The instruction
scheduler cannot perform this optimization if it is not permitted to
separate the definition and use of the condition code register.

   On these machines, do not use `(cc0)', but instead use a register to
represent the condition code.  If there is a specific condition code
register in the machine, use a hard register.  If the condition code or
comparison result can be placed in any general register, or if there are
multiple condition registers, use a pseudo register.

   On some machines, the type of branch instruction generated may
depend on the way the condition code was produced; for example, on the
68k and Sparc, setting the condition code directly from an add or
subtract instruction does not clear the overflow bit the way that a test
instruction does, so a different branch instruction must be used for
some conditional branches.  For machines that use `(cc0)', the set and
use of the condition code must be adjacent (separated only by `note'
insns) allowing flags in `cc_status' to be used.  (*Note Condition
Code::.)  Also, the comparison and branch insns can be located from
each other by using the functions `prev_cc0_setter' and `next_cc0_user'.

   However, this is not true on machines that do not use `(cc0)'.  On
those machines, no assumptions can be made about the adjacency of the
compare and branch insns and the above methods cannot be used.  Instead,
we use the machine mode of the condition code register to record
different formats of the condition code register.

   Registers used to store the condition code value should have a mode
that is in class `MODE_CC'.  Normally, it will be `CCmode'.  If
additional modes are required (as for the add example mentioned above in
the Sparc), define the macro `EXTRA_CC_MODES' to list the additional
modes required (*note Condition Code::).  Also define `EXTRA_CC_NAMES'
to list the names of those modes and `SELECT_CC_MODE' to choose a mode
given an operand of a compare.

   If it is known during RTL generation that a different mode will be
required (for example, if the machine has separate compare instructions
for signed and unsigned quantities, like most IBM processors), they can
be specified at that time.

   If the cases that require different modes would be made by
instruction combination, the macro `SELECT_CC_MODE' determines which
machine mode should be used for the comparison result.  The patterns
should be written using that mode.  To support the case of the add on
the Sparc discussed above, we have the pattern

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (reg:CC_NOOV 0)
             (compare:CC_NOOV
               (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "%r")
                        (match_operand:SI 1 "arith_operand" "rI"))
               (const_int 0)))]
       ""
       "...")

   The `SELECT_CC_MODE' macro on the Sparc returns `CC_NOOVmode' for
comparisons whose argument is a `plus'.

16.11 Canonicalization of Instructions
======================================

There are often cases where multiple RTL expressions could represent an
operation performed by a single machine instruction.  This situation is
most commonly encountered with logical, branch, and multiply-accumulate
instructions.  In such cases, the compiler attempts to convert these
multiple RTL expressions into a single canonical form to reduce the
number of insn patterns required.

   In addition to algebraic simplifications, following canonicalizations
are performed:

   * For commutative and comparison operators, a constant is always
     made the second operand.  If a machine only supports a constant as
     the second operand, only patterns that match a constant in the
     second operand need be supplied.

     For these operators, if only one operand is a `neg', `not',
     `mult', `plus', or `minus' expression, it will be the first
     operand.

   * For the `compare' operator, a constant is always the second operand
     on machines where `cc0' is used (*note Jump Patterns::).  On other
     machines, there are rare cases where the compiler might want to
     construct a `compare' with a constant as the first operand.
     However, these cases are not common enough for it to be worthwhile
     to provide a pattern matching a constant as the first operand
     unless the machine actually has such an instruction.

     An operand of `neg', `not', `mult', `plus', or `minus' is made the
     first operand under the same conditions as above.

   * `(minus X (const_int N))' is converted to `(plus X (const_int
     -N))'.

   * Within address computations (i.e., inside `mem'), a left shift is
     converted into the appropriate multiplication by a power of two.

   * De`Morgan's Law is used to move bitwise negation inside a bitwise
     logical-and or logical-or operation.  If this results in only one
     operand being a `not' expression, it will be the first one.

     A machine that has an instruction that performs a bitwise
     logical-and of one operand with the bitwise negation of the other
     should specify the pattern for that instruction as

          (define_insn ""
            [(set (match_operand:M 0 ...)
                  (and:M (not:M (match_operand:M 1 ...))
                               (match_operand:M 2 ...)))]
            "..."
            "...")

     Similarly, a pattern for a "NAND" instruction should be written

          (define_insn ""
            [(set (match_operand:M 0 ...)
                  (ior:M (not:M (match_operand:M 1 ...))
                               (not:M (match_operand:M 2 ...))))]
            "..."
            "...")

     In both cases, it is not necessary to include patterns for the many
     logically equivalent RTL expressions.

   * The only possible RTL expressions involving both bitwise
     exclusive-or and bitwise negation are `(xor:M X Y)' and `(not:M
     (xor:M X Y))'.

   * The sum of three items, one of which is a constant, will only
     appear in the form

          (plus:M (plus:M X Y) CONSTANT)

   * On machines that do not use `cc0', `(compare X (const_int 0))'
     will be converted to X.

   * Equality comparisons of a group of bits (usually a single bit)
     with zero will be written using `zero_extract' rather than the
     equivalent `and' or `sign_extract' operations.

16.12 Machine-Specific Peephole Optimizers
==========================================

In addition to instruction patterns the `md' file may contain
definitions of machine-specific peephole optimizations.

   The combiner does not notice certain peephole optimizations when the
data flow in the program does not suggest that it should try them.  For
example, sometimes two consecutive insns related in purpose can be
combined even though the second one does not appear to use a register
computed in the first one.  A machine-specific peephole optimizer can
detect such opportunities.

   A definition looks like this:

     (define_peephole
       [INSN-PATTERN-1
        INSN-PATTERN-2
        ...]
       "CONDITION"
       "TEMPLATE"
       "OPTIONAL INSN-ATTRIBUTES")

The last string operand may be omitted if you are not using any
machine-specific information in this machine description.  If present,
it must obey the same rules as in a `define_insn'.

   In this skeleton, INSN-PATTERN-1 and so on are patterns to match
consecutive insns.  The optimization applies to a sequence of insns when
INSN-PATTERN-1 matches the first one, INSN-PATTERN-2 matches the next,
and so on.

   Each of the insns matched by a peephole must also match a
`define_insn'.  Peepholes are checked only at the last stage just
before code generation, and only optionally.  Therefore, any insn which
would match a peephole but no `define_insn' will cause a crash in code
generation in an unoptimized compilation, or at various optimization
stages.

   The operands of the insns are matched with `match_operands',
`match_operator', and `match_dup', as usual.  What is not usual is that
the operand numbers apply to all the insn patterns in the definition.
So, you can check for identical operands in two insns by using
`match_operand' in one insn and `match_dup' in the other.

   The operand constraints used in `match_operand' patterns do not have
any direct effect on the applicability of the peephole, but they will
be validated afterward, so make sure your constraints are general enough
to apply whenever the peephole matches.  If the peephole matches but
the constraints are not satisfied, the compiler will crash.

   It is safe to omit constraints in all the operands of the peephole;
or you can write constraints which serve as a double-check on the
criteria previously tested.

   Once a sequence of insns matches the patterns, the CONDITION is
checked.  This is a C expression which makes the final decision whether
to perform the optimization (we do so if the expression is nonzero).  If
CONDITION is omitted (in other words, the string is empty) then the
optimization is applied to every sequence of insns that matches the
patterns.

   The defined peephole optimizations are applied after register
allocation is complete.  Therefore, the peephole definition can check
which operands have ended up in which kinds of registers, just by
looking at the operands.

   The way to refer to the operands in CONDITION is to write
`operands[I]' for operand number I (as matched by `(match_operand I
...)').  Use the variable `insn' to refer to the last of the insns
being matched; use `prev_active_insn' to find the preceding insns.

   When optimizing computations with intermediate results, you can use
CONDITION to match only when the intermediate results are not used
elsewhere.  Use the C expression `dead_or_set_p (INSN, OP)', where INSN
is the insn in which you expect the value to be used for the last time
(from the value of `insn', together with use of `prev_nonnote_insn'),
and OP is the intermediate value (from `operands[I]').

   Applying the optimization means replacing the sequence of insns with
one new insn.  The TEMPLATE controls ultimate output of assembler code
for this combined insn.  It works exactly like the template of a
`define_insn'.  Operand numbers in this template are the same ones used
in matching the original sequence of insns.

   The result of a defined peephole optimizer does not need to match
any of the insn patterns in the machine description; it does not even
have an opportunity to match them.  The peephole optimizer definition
itself serves as the insn pattern to control how the insn is output.

   Defined peephole optimizers are run as assembler code is being
output, so the insns they produce are never combined or rearranged in
any way.

   Here is an example, taken from the 68000 machine description:

     (define_peephole
       [(set (reg:SI 15) (plus:SI (reg:SI 15) (const_int 4)))
        (set (match_operand:DF 0 "register_operand" "=f")
             (match_operand:DF 1 "register_operand" "ad"))]
       "FP_REG_P (operands[0]) && ! FP_REG_P (operands[1])"
       "*
     {
       rtx xoperands[2];
       xoperands[1] = gen_rtx (REG, SImode, REGNO (operands[1]) + 1);
     #ifdef MOTOROLA
       output_asm_insn (\"move.l %1,(sp)\", xoperands);
       output_asm_insn (\"move.l %1,-(sp)\", operands);
       return \"fmove.d (sp)+,%0\";
     #else
       output_asm_insn (\"movel %1,sp@\", xoperands);
       output_asm_insn (\"movel %1,sp@-\", operands);
       return \"fmoved sp@+,%0\";
     #endif
     }
     ")

   The effect of this optimization is to change

     jbsr _foobar
     addql #4,sp
     movel d1,sp@-
     movel d0,sp@-
     fmoved sp@+,fp0

into

     jbsr _foobar
     movel d1,sp@
     movel d0,sp@-
     fmoved sp@+,fp0

   INSN-PATTERN-1 and so on look _almost_ like the second operand of
`define_insn'.  There is one important difference: the second operand
of `define_insn' consists of one or more RTX's enclosed in square
brackets.  Usually, there is only one: then the same action can be
written as an element of a `define_peephole'.  But when there are
multiple actions in a `define_insn', they are implicitly enclosed in a
`parallel'.  Then you must explicitly write the `parallel', and the
square brackets within it, in the `define_peephole'.  Thus, if an insn
pattern looks like this,

     (define_insn "divmodsi4"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=d")
             (div:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0")
                     (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "dmsK")))
        (set (match_operand:SI 3 "general_operand" "=d")
             (mod:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 2)))]
       "TARGET_68020"
       "divsl%.l %2,%3:%0")

then the way to mention this insn in a peephole is as follows:

     (define_peephole
       [...
        (parallel
         [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=d")
               (div:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "0")
                       (match_operand:SI 2 "general_operand" "dmsK")))
          (set (match_operand:SI 3 "general_operand" "=d")
               (mod:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 2)))])
        ...]
       ...)

16.13 Defining RTL Sequences for Code Generation
================================================

On some target machines, some standard pattern names for RTL generation
cannot be handled with single insn, but a sequence of RTL insns can
represent them.  For these target machines, you can write a
`define_expand' to specify how to generate the sequence of RTL.

   A `define_expand' is an RTL expression that looks almost like a
`define_insn'; but, unlike the latter, a `define_expand' is used only
for RTL generation and it can produce more than one RTL insn.

   A `define_expand' RTX has four operands:

   * The name.  Each `define_expand' must have a name, since the only
     use for it is to refer to it by name.

   * The RTL template.  This is just like the RTL template for a
     `define_peephole' in that it is a vector of RTL expressions each
     being one insn.

   * The condition, a string containing a C expression.  This
     expression is used to express how the availability of this pattern
     depends on subclasses of target machine, selected by command-line
     options when GNU CC is run.  This is just like the condition of a
     `define_insn' that has a standard name.  Therefore, the condition
     (if present) may not depend on the data in the insn being matched,
     but only the target-machine-type flags.  The compiler needs to
     test these conditions during initialization in order to learn
     exactly which named instructions are available in a particular run.

   * The preparation statements, a string containing zero or more C
     statements which are to be executed before RTL code is generated
     from the RTL template.

     Usually these statements prepare temporary registers for use as
     internal operands in the RTL template, but they can also generate
     RTL insns directly by calling routines such as `emit_insn', etc.
     Any such insns precede the ones that come from the RTL template.

   Every RTL insn emitted by a `define_expand' must match some
`define_insn' in the machine description.  Otherwise, the compiler will
crash when trying to generate code for the insn or trying to optimize
it.

   The RTL template, in addition to controlling generation of RTL insns,
also describes the operands that need to be specified when this pattern
is used.  In particular, it gives a predicate for each operand.

   A true operand, which needs to be specified in order to generate RTL
from the pattern, should be described with a `match_operand' in its
first occurrence in the RTL template.  This enters information on the
operand's predicate into the tables that record such things.  GNU CC
uses the information to preload the operand into a register if that is
required for valid RTL code.  If the operand is referred to more than
once, subsequent references should use `match_dup'.

   The RTL template may also refer to internal "operands" which are
temporary registers or labels used only within the sequence made by the
`define_expand'.  Internal operands are substituted into the RTL
template with `match_dup', never with `match_operand'.  The values of
the internal operands are not passed in as arguments by the compiler
when it requests use of this pattern.  Instead, they are computed
within the pattern, in the preparation statements.  These statements
compute the values and store them into the appropriate elements of
`operands' so that `match_dup' can find them.

   There are two special macros defined for use in the preparation
statements: `DONE' and `FAIL'.  Use them with a following semicolon, as
a statement.

`DONE'
     Use the `DONE' macro to end RTL generation for the pattern.  The
     only RTL insns resulting from the pattern on this occasion will be
     those already emitted by explicit calls to `emit_insn' within the
     preparation statements; the RTL template will not be generated.

`FAIL'
     Make the pattern fail on this occasion.  When a pattern fails, it
     means that the pattern was not truly available.  The calling
     routines in the compiler will try other strategies for code
     generation using other patterns.

     Failure is currently supported only for binary (addition,
     multiplication, shifting, etc.) and bitfield (`extv', `extzv', and
     `insv') operations.

   Here is an example, the definition of left-shift for the SPUR chip:

     (define_expand "ashlsi3"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "")
             (ashift:SI
               (match_operand:SI 1 "register_operand" "")
               (match_operand:SI 2 "nonmemory_operand" "")))]
       ""
       "

     {
       if (GET_CODE (operands[2]) != CONST_INT
           || (unsigned) INTVAL (operands[2]) > 3)
         FAIL;
     }")

This example uses `define_expand' so that it can generate an RTL insn
for shifting when the shift-count is in the supported range of 0 to 3
but fail in other cases where machine insns aren't available.  When it
fails, the compiler tries another strategy using different patterns
(such as, a library call).

   If the compiler were able to handle nontrivial condition-strings in
patterns with names, then it would be possible to use a `define_insn'
in that case.  Here is another case (zero-extension on the 68000) which
makes more use of the power of `define_expand':

     (define_expand "zero_extendhisi2"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "")
             (const_int 0))
        (set (strict_low_part
               (subreg:HI
                 (match_dup 0)
                 0))
             (match_operand:HI 1 "general_operand" ""))]
       ""
       "operands[1] = make_safe_from (operands[1], operands[0]);")

Here two RTL insns are generated, one to clear the entire output operand
and the other to copy the input operand into its low half.  This
sequence is incorrect if the input operand refers to [the old value of]
the output operand, so the preparation statement makes sure this isn't
so.  The function `make_safe_from' copies the `operands[1]' into a
temporary register if it refers to `operands[0]'.  It does this by
emitting another RTL insn.

   Finally, a third example shows the use of an internal operand.
Zero-extension on the SPUR chip is done by `and'-ing the result against
a halfword mask.  But this mask cannot be represented by a `const_int'
because the constant value is too large to be legitimate on this
machine.  So it must be copied into a register with `force_reg' and
then the register used in the `and'.

     (define_expand "zero_extendhisi2"
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "register_operand" "")
             (and:SI (subreg:SI
                       (match_operand:HI 1 "register_operand" "")
                       0)
                     (match_dup 2)))]
       ""
       "operands[2]
          = force_reg (SImode, GEN_INT (65535)); ")

   *Note_* If the `define_expand' is used to serve a standard binary or
unary arithmetic operation or a bitfield operation, then the last insn
it generates must not be a `code_label', `barrier' or `note'.  It must
be an `insn', `jump_insn' or `call_insn'.  If you don't need a real insn
at the end, emit an insn to copy the result of the operation into
itself.  Such an insn will generate no code, but it can avoid problems
in the compiler.

16.14 Defining How to Split Instructions
========================================

There are two cases where you should specify how to split a pattern into
multiple insns.  On machines that have instructions requiring delay
slots (*note Delay Slots::) or that have instructions whose output is
not available for multiple cycles (*note Function Units::), the compiler
phases that optimize these cases need to be able to move insns into
one-instruction delay slots.  However, some insns may generate more
than one machine instruction.  These insns cannot be placed into a
delay slot.

   Often you can rewrite the single insn as a list of individual insns,
each corresponding to one machine instruction.  The disadvantage of
doing so is that it will cause the compilation to be slower and require
more space.  If the resulting insns are too complex, it may also
suppress some optimizations.  The compiler splits the insn if there is a
reason to believe that it might improve instruction or delay slot
scheduling.

   The insn combiner phase also splits putative insns.  If three insns
are merged into one insn with a complex expression that cannot be
matched by some `define_insn' pattern, the combiner phase attempts to
split the complex pattern into two insns that are recognized.  Usually
it can break the complex pattern into two patterns by splitting out some
subexpression.  However, in some other cases, such as performing an
addition of a large constant in two insns on a RISC machine, the way to
split the addition into two insns is machine-dependent.

   The `define_split' definition tells the compiler how to split a
complex insn into several simpler insns.  It looks like this:

     (define_split
       [INSN-PATTERN]
       "CONDITION"
       [NEW-INSN-PATTERN-1
        NEW-INSN-PATTERN-2
        ...]
       "PREPARATION STATEMENTS")

   INSN-PATTERN is a pattern that needs to be split and CONDITION is
the final condition to be tested, as in a `define_insn'.  When an insn
matching INSN-PATTERN and satisfying CONDITION is found, it is replaced
in the insn list with the insns given by NEW-INSN-PATTERN-1,
NEW-INSN-PATTERN-2, etc.

   The PREPARATION STATEMENTS are similar to those statements that are
specified for `define_expand' (*note Expander Definitions::) and are
executed before the new RTL is generated to prepare for the generated
code or emit some insns whose pattern is not fixed.  Unlike those in
`define_expand', however, these statements must not generate any new
pseudo-registers.  Once reload has completed, they also must not
allocate any space in the stack frame.

   Patterns are matched against INSN-PATTERN in two different
circumstances.  If an insn needs to be split for delay slot scheduling
or insn scheduling, the insn is already known to be valid, which means
that it must have been matched by some `define_insn' and, if
`reload_completed' is non-zero, is known to satisfy the constraints of
that `define_insn'.  In that case, the new insn patterns must also be
insns that are matched by some `define_insn' and, if `reload_completed'
is non-zero, must also satisfy the constraints of those definitions.

   As an example of this usage of `define_split', consider the following
example from `a29k.md', which splits a `sign_extend' from `HImode' to
`SImode' into a pair of shift insns:

     (define_split
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "gen_reg_operand" "")
             (sign_extend:SI (match_operand:HI 1 "gen_reg_operand" "")))]
       ""
       [(set (match_dup 0)
             (ashift:SI (match_dup 1)
                        (const_int 16)))
        (set (match_dup 0)
             (ashiftrt:SI (match_dup 0)
                          (const_int 16)))]
       "
     { operands[1] = gen_lowpart (SImode, operands[1]); }")

   When the combiner phase tries to split an insn pattern, it is always
the case that the pattern is _not_ matched by any `define_insn'.  The
combiner pass first tries to split a single `set' expression and then
the same `set' expression inside a `parallel', but followed by a
`clobber' of a pseudo-reg to use as a scratch register.  In these
cases, the combiner expects exactly two new insn patterns to be
generated.  It will verify that these patterns match some `define_insn'
definitions, so you need not do this test in the `define_split' (of
course, there is no point in writing a `define_split' that will never
produce insns that match).

   Here is an example of this use of `define_split', taken from
`rs6000.md':

     (define_split
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "gen_reg_operand" "")
             (plus:SI (match_operand:SI 1 "gen_reg_operand" "")
                      (match_operand:SI 2 "non_add_cint_operand" "")))]
       ""
       [(set (match_dup 0) (plus:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 3)))
        (set (match_dup 0) (plus:SI (match_dup 0) (match_dup 4)))]
     "
     {
       int low = INTVAL (operands[2]) & 0xffff;
       int high = (unsigned) INTVAL (operands[2]) >> 16;

       if (low & 0x8000)
         high++, low |= 0xffff0000;

       operands[3] = GEN_INT (high << 16);
       operands[4] = GEN_INT (low);
     }")

   Here the predicate `non_add_cint_operand' matches any `const_int'
that is _not_ a valid operand of a single add insn.  The add with the
smaller displacement is written so that it can be substituted into the
address of a subsequent operation.

   An example that uses a scratch register, from the same file,
generates an equality comparison of a register and a large constant:

     (define_split
       [(set (match_operand:CC 0 "cc_reg_operand" "")
             (compare:CC (match_operand:SI 1 "gen_reg_operand" "")
                         (match_operand:SI 2 "non_short_cint_operand" "")))
        (clobber (match_operand:SI 3 "gen_reg_operand" ""))]
       "find_single_use (operands[0], insn, 0)
        && (GET_CODE (*find_single_use (operands[0], insn, 0)) == EQ
            || GET_CODE (*find_single_use (operands[0], insn, 0)) == NE)"
       [(set (match_dup 3) (xor:SI (match_dup 1) (match_dup 4)))
        (set (match_dup 0) (compare:CC (match_dup 3) (match_dup 5)))]
       "
     {
       /* Get the constant we are comparing against, C, and see what it
          looks like sign-extended to 16 bits.  Then see what constant
          could be XOR'ed with C to get the sign-extended value.  */

       int c = INTVAL (operands[2]);
       int sextc = (c << 16) >> 16;
       int xorv = c ^ sextc;

       operands[4] = GEN_INT (xorv);
       operands[5] = GEN_INT (sextc);
     }")

   To avoid confusion, don't write a single `define_split' that accepts
some insns that match some `define_insn' as well as some insns that
don't.  Instead, write two separate `define_split' definitions, one for
the insns that are valid and one for the insns that are not valid.

16.15 Instruction Attributes
============================

In addition to describing the instruction supported by the target
machine, the `md' file also defines a group of "attributes" and a set of
values for each.  Every generated insn is assigned a value for each
attribute.  One possible attribute would be the effect that the insn
has on the machine's condition code.  This attribute can then be used
by `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' to track the condition codes.

* Menu:

* Defining Attributes:: Specifying attributes and their values.
* Expressions::         Valid expressions for attribute values.
* Tagging Insns::       Assigning attribute values to insns.
* Attr Example::        An example of assigning attributes.

File: gcc.info,  Node: Defining Attributes,  Next: Expressions,  Up: Insn Attributes

16.15.1 Defining Attributes and their Values
--------------------------------------------

The `define_attr' expression is used to define each attribute required
by the target machine.  It looks like:

     (define_attr NAME LIST-OF-VALUES DEFAULT)

   NAME is a string specifying the name of the attribute being defined.

   LIST-OF-VALUES is either a string that specifies a comma-separated
list of values that can be assigned to the attribute, or a null string
to indicate that the attribute takes numeric values.

   DEFAULT is an attribute expression that gives the value of this
attribute for insns that match patterns whose definition does not
include an explicit value for this attribute.  *Note Attr Example::,
for more information on the handling of defaults.  *Note Constant
Attributes::, for information on attributes that do not depend on any
particular insn.

   For each defined attribute, a number of definitions are written to
the `insn-attr.h' file.  For cases where an explicit set of values is
specified for an attribute, the following are defined:

   * A `#define' is written for the symbol `HAVE_ATTR_NAME'.

   * An enumeral class is defined for `attr_NAME' with elements of the
     form `UPPER-NAME_UPPER-VALUE' where the attribute name and value
     are first converted to upper case.

   * A function `get_attr_NAME' is defined that is passed an insn and
     returns the attribute value for that insn.

   For example, if the following is present in the `md' file:

     (define_attr "type" "branch,fp,load,store,arith" ...)

the following lines will be written to the file `insn-attr.h'.

     #define HAVE_ATTR_type
     enum attr_type {TYPE_BRANCH, TYPE_FP, TYPE_LOAD,
                      TYPE_STORE, TYPE_ARITH};
     extern enum attr_type get_attr_type ();

   If the attribute takes numeric values, no `enum' type will be
defined and the function to obtain the attribute's value will return
`int'.

16.15.2 Attribute Expressions
-----------------------------

RTL expressions used to define attributes use the codes described above
plus a few specific to attribute definitions, to be discussed below.
Attribute value expressions must have one of the following forms:

`(const_int I)'
     The integer I specifies the value of a numeric attribute.  I must
     be non-negative.

     The value of a numeric attribute can be specified either with a
     `const_int', or as an integer represented as a string in
     `const_string', `eq_attr' (see below), `attr', `symbol_ref',
     simple arithmetic expressions, and `set_attr' overrides on
     specific instructions (*note Tagging Insns::).

`(const_string VALUE)'
     The string VALUE specifies a constant attribute value.  If VALUE
     is specified as `"*"', it means that the default value of the
     attribute is to be used for the insn containing this expression.
     `"*"' obviously cannot be used in the DEFAULT expression of a
     `define_attr'.

     If the attribute whose value is being specified is numeric, VALUE
     must be a string containing a non-negative integer (normally
     `const_int' would be used in this case).  Otherwise, it must
     contain one of the valid values for the attribute.

`(if_then_else TEST TRUE-VALUE FALSE-VALUE)'
     TEST specifies an attribute test, whose format is defined below.
     The value of this expression is TRUE-VALUE if TEST is true,
     otherwise it is FALSE-VALUE.

`(cond [TEST1 VALUE1 ...] DEFAULT)'
     The first operand of this expression is a vector containing an even
     number of expressions and consisting of pairs of TEST and VALUE
     expressions.  The value of the `cond' expression is that of the
     VALUE corresponding to the first true TEST expression.  If none of
     the TEST expressions are true, the value of the `cond' expression
     is that of the DEFAULT expression.

   TEST expressions can have one of the following forms:

`(const_int I)'
     This test is true if I is non-zero and false otherwise.

`(not TEST)'
`(ior TEST1 TEST2)'
`(and TEST1 TEST2)'
     These tests are true if the indicated logical function is true.

`(match_operand:M N PRED CONSTRAINTS)'
     This test is true if operand N of the insn whose attribute value
     is being determined has mode M (this part of the test is ignored
     if M is `VOIDmode') and the function specified by the string PRED
     returns a non-zero value when passed operand N and mode M (this
     part of the test is ignored if PRED is the null string).

     The CONSTRAINTS operand is ignored and should be the null string.

`(le ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(leu ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(lt ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(ltu ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(gt ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(gtu ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(ge ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(geu ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(ne ARITH1 ARITH2)'
`(eq ARITH1 ARITH2)'
     These tests are true if the indicated comparison of the two
     arithmetic expressions is true.  Arithmetic expressions are formed
     with `plus', `minus', `mult', `div', `mod', `abs', `neg', `and',
     `ior', `xor', `not', `ashift', `lshiftrt', and `ashiftrt'
     expressions.

     `const_int' and `symbol_ref' are always valid terms (*note Insn
     Lengths::,for additional forms).  `symbol_ref' is a string
     denoting a C expression that yields an `int' when evaluated by the
     `get_attr_...' routine.  It should normally be a global variable.

`(eq_attr NAME VALUE)'
     NAME is a string specifying the name of an attribute.

     VALUE is a string that is either a valid value for attribute NAME,
     a comma-separated list of values, or `!' followed by a value or
     list.  If VALUE does not begin with a `!', this test is true if
     the value of the NAME attribute of the current insn is in the list
     specified by VALUE.  If VALUE begins with a `!', this test is true
     if the attribute's value is _not_ in the specified list.

     For example,

          (eq_attr "type" "load,store")

     is equivalent to

          (ior (eq_attr "type" "load") (eq_attr "type" "store"))

     If NAME specifies an attribute of `alternative', it refers to the
     value of the compiler variable `which_alternative' (*note Output
     Statement::) and the values must be small integers.  For example,

          (eq_attr "alternative" "2,3")

     is equivalent to

          (ior (eq (symbol_ref "which_alternative") (const_int 2))
               (eq (symbol_ref "which_alternative") (const_int 3)))

     Note that, for most attributes, an `eq_attr' test is simplified in
     cases where the value of the attribute being tested is known for
     all insns matching a particular pattern.  This is by far the most
     common case.

`(attr_flag NAME)'
     The value of an `attr_flag' expression is true if the flag
     specified by NAME is true for the `insn' currently being scheduled.

     NAME is a string specifying one of a fixed set of flags to test.
     Test the flags `forward' and `backward' to determine the direction
     of a conditional branch.  Test the flags `very_likely', `likely',
     `very_unlikely', and `unlikely' to determine if a conditional
     branch is expected to be taken.

     If the `very_likely' flag is true, then the `likely' flag is also
     true.  Likewise for the `very_unlikely' and `unlikely' flags.

     This example describes a conditional branch delay slot which can
     be nullified for forward branches that are taken (annul-true) or
     for backward branches which are not taken (annul-false).

          (define_delay (eq_attr "type" "cbranch")
            [(eq_attr "in_branch_delay" "true")
             (and (eq_attr "in_branch_delay" "true")
                  (attr_flag "forward"))
             (and (eq_attr "in_branch_delay" "true")
                  (attr_flag "backward"))])

     The `forward' and `backward' flags are false if the current `insn'
     being scheduled is not a conditional branch.

     The `very_likely' and `likely' flags are true if the `insn' being
     scheduled is not a conditional branch.  The `very_unlikely' and
     `unlikely' flags are false if the `insn' being scheduled is not a
     conditional branch.

     `attr_flag' is only used during delay slot scheduling and has no
     meaning to other passes of the compiler.

`(attr NAME)'
     The value of another attribute is returned.  This is most useful
     for numeric attributes, as `eq_attr' and `attr_flag' produce more
     efficient code for non-numeric attributes.

16.15.3 Assigning Attribute Values to Insns
-------------------------------------------

The value assigned to an attribute of an insn is primarily determined by
which pattern is matched by that insn (or which `define_peephole'
generated it).  Every `define_insn' and `define_peephole' can have an
optional last argument to specify the values of attributes for matching
insns.  The value of any attribute not specified in a particular insn
is set to the default value for that attribute, as specified in its
`define_attr'.  Extensive use of default values for attributes permits
the specification of the values for only one or two attributes in the
definition of most insn patterns, as seen in the example in the next
section.

   The optional last argument of `define_insn' and `define_peephole' is
a vector of expressions, each of which defines the value for a single
attribute.  The most general way of assigning an attribute's value is
to use a `set' expression whose first operand is an `attr' expression
giving the name of the attribute being set.  The second operand of the
`set' is an attribute expression (*note Expressions::) giving the value
of the attribute.

   When the attribute value depends on the `alternative' attribute
(i.e., which is the applicable alternative in the constraint of the
insn), the `set_attr_alternative' expression can be used.  It allows
the specification of a vector of attribute expressions, one for each
alternative.

   When the generality of arbitrary attribute expressions is not
required, the simpler `set_attr' expression can be used, which allows
specifying a string giving either a single attribute value or a list of
attribute values, one for each alternative.

   The form of each of the above specifications is shown below.  In
each case, NAME is a string specifying the attribute to be set.

`(set_attr NAME VALUE-STRING)'
     VALUE-STRING is either a string giving the desired attribute value,
     or a string containing a comma-separated list giving the values for
     succeeding alternatives.  The number of elements must match the
     number of alternatives in the constraint of the insn pattern.

     Note that it may be useful to specify `*' for some alternative, in
     which case the attribute will assume its default value for insns
     matching that alternative.

`(set_attr_alternative NAME [VALUE1 VALUE2 ...])'
     Depending on the alternative of the insn, the value will be one of
     the specified values.  This is a shorthand for using a `cond' with
     tests on the `alternative' attribute.

`(set (attr NAME) VALUE)'
     The first operand of this `set' must be the special RTL expression
     `attr', whose sole operand is a string giving the name of the
     attribute being set.  VALUE is the value of the attribute.

   The following shows three different ways of representing the same
attribute value specification:

     (set_attr "type" "load,store,arith")

     (set_attr_alternative "type"
                           [(const_string "load") (const_string "store")
                            (const_string "arith")])

     (set (attr "type")
          (cond [(eq_attr "alternative" "1") (const_string "load")
                 (eq_attr "alternative" "2") (const_string "store")]
                (const_string "arith")))

   The `define_asm_attributes' expression provides a mechanism to
specify the attributes assigned to insns produced from an `asm'
statement.  It has the form:

     (define_asm_attributes [ATTR-SETS])

where ATTR-SETS is specified the same as for both the `define_insn' and
the `define_peephole' expressions.

   These values will typically be the "worst case" attribute values.
For example, they might indicate that the condition code will be
clobbered.

   A specification for a `length' attribute is handled specially.  The
way to compute the length of an `asm' insn is to multiply the length
specified in the expression `define_asm_attributes' by the number of
machine instructions specified in the `asm' statement, determined by
counting the number of semicolons and newlines in the string.
Therefore, the value of the `length' attribute specified in a
`define_asm_attributes' should be the maximum possible length of a
single machine instruction.

16.15.4 Example of Attribute Specifications
-------------------------------------------

The judicious use of defaulting is important in the efficient use of
insn attributes.  Typically, insns are divided into "types" and an
attribute, customarily called `type', is used to represent this value.
This attribute is normally used only to define the default value for
other attributes.  An example will clarify this usage.

   Assume we have a RISC machine with a condition code and in which only
full-word operations are performed in registers.  Let us assume that we
can divide all insns into loads, stores, (integer) arithmetic
operations, floating point operations, and branches.

   Here we will concern ourselves with determining the effect of an
insn on the condition code and will limit ourselves to the following
possible effects:  The condition code can be set unpredictably
(clobbered), not be changed, be set to agree with the results of the
operation, or only changed if the item previously set into the
condition code has been modified.

   Here is part of a sample `md' file for such a machine:

     (define_attr "type" "load,store,arith,fp,branch" (const_string "arith"))

     (define_attr "cc" "clobber,unchanged,set,change0"
                  (cond [(eq_attr "type" "load")
                             (const_string "change0")
                         (eq_attr "type" "store,branch")
                             (const_string "unchanged")
                         (eq_attr "type" "arith")
                             (if_then_else (match_operand:SI 0 "" "")
                                           (const_string "set")
                                           (const_string "clobber"))]
                        (const_string "clobber")))

     (define_insn ""
       [(set (match_operand:SI 0 "general_operand" "=r,r,m")
             (match_operand:SI 1 "general_operand" "r,m,r"))]
       ""
       "@
        move %0,%1
        load %0,%1
        store %0,%1"
       [(set_attr "type" "arith,load,store")])

   Note that we assume in the above example that arithmetic operations
performed on quantities smaller than a machine word clobber the
condition code since they will set the condition code to a value
corresponding to the full-word result.

16.15.5 Computing the Length of an Insn
---------------------------------------

For many machines, multiple types of branch instructions are provided,
each for different length branch displacements.  In most cases, the
assembler will choose the correct instruction to use.  However, when
the assembler cannot do so, GCC can when a special attribute, the
`length' attribute, is defined.  This attribute must be defined to have
numeric values by specifying a null string in its `define_attr'.

   In the case of the `length' attribute, two additional forms of
arithmetic terms are allowed in test expressions:

`(match_dup N)'
     This refers to the address of operand N of the current insn, which
     must be a `label_ref'.

`(pc)'
     This refers to the address of the _current_ insn.  It might have
     been more consistent with other usage to make this the address of
     the _next_ insn but this would be confusing because the length of
     the current insn is to be computed.

   For normal insns, the length will be determined by value of the
`length' attribute.  In the case of `addr_vec' and `addr_diff_vec' insn
patterns, the length is computed as the number of vectors multiplied by
the size of each vector.

   Lengths are measured in addressable storage units (bytes).

   The following macros can be used to refine the length computation:

`FIRST_INSN_ADDRESS'
     When the `length' insn attribute is used, this macro specifies the
     value to be assigned to the address of the first insn in a
     function.  If not specified, 0 is used.

`ADJUST_INSN_LENGTH (INSN, LENGTH)'
     If defined, modifies the length assigned to instruction INSN as a
     function of the context in which it is used.  LENGTH is an lvalue
     that contains the initially computed length of the insn and should
     be updated with the correct length of the insn.

     This macro will normally not be required.  A case in which it is
     required is the ROMP.  On this machine, the size of an `addr_vec'
     insn must be increased by two to compensate for the fact that
     alignment may be required.

   The routine that returns `get_attr_length' (the value of the
`length' attribute) can be used by the output routine to determine the
form of the branch instruction to be written, as the example below
illustrates.

   As an example of the specification of variable-length branches,
consider the IBM 360.  If we adopt the convention that a register will
be set to the starting address of a function, we can jump to labels
within 4k of the start using a four-byte instruction.  Otherwise, we
need a six-byte sequence to load the address from memory and then
branch to it.

   On such a machine, a pattern for a branch instruction might be
specified as follows:

     (define_insn "jump"
       [(set (pc)
             (label_ref (match_operand 0 "" "")))]
       ""
       "*
     {
        return (get_attr_length (insn) == 4
                ? \"b %l0\" : \"l r15,=a(%l0); br r15\");
     }"
       [(set (attr "length") (if_then_else (lt (match_dup 0) (const_int 4096))
                                           (const_int 4)
                                           (const_int 6)))])

16.15.6 Constant Attributes
---------------------------

A special form of `define_attr', where the expression for the default
value is a `const' expression, indicates an attribute that is constant
for a given run of the compiler.  Constant attributes may be used to
specify which variety of processor is used.  For example,

     (define_attr "cpu" "m88100,m88110,m88000"
      (const
       (cond [(symbol_ref "TARGET_88100") (const_string "m88100")
              (symbol_ref "TARGET_88110") (const_string "m88110")]
             (const_string "m88000"))))

     (define_attr "memory" "fast,slow"
      (const
       (if_then_else (symbol_ref "TARGET_FAST_MEM")
                     (const_string "fast")
                     (const_string "slow"))))

   The routine generated for constant attributes has no parameters as it
does not depend on any particular insn.  RTL expressions used to define
the value of a constant attribute may use the `symbol_ref' form, but
may not use either the `match_operand' form or `eq_attr' forms
involving insn attributes.

16.15.7 Delay Slot Scheduling
-----------------------------

The insn attribute mechanism can be used to specify the requirements for
delay slots, if any, on a target machine.  An instruction is said to
require a "delay slot" if some instructions that are physically after
the instruction are executed as if they were located before it.
Classic examples are branch and call instructions, which often execute
the following instruction before the branch or call is performed.

   On some machines, conditional branch instructions can optionally
"annul" instructions in the delay slot.  This means that the
instruction will not be executed for certain branch outcomes.  Both
instructions that annul if the branch is true and instructions that
annul if the branch is false are supported.

   Delay slot scheduling differs from instruction scheduling in that
determining whether an instruction needs a delay slot is dependent only
on the type of instruction being generated, not on data flow between the
instructions.  See the next section for a discussion of data-dependent
instruction scheduling.

   The requirement of an insn needing one or more delay slots is
indicated via the `define_delay' expression.  It has the following form:

     (define_delay TEST
                   [DELAY-1 ANNUL-TRUE-1 ANNUL-FALSE-1
                    DELAY-2 ANNUL-TRUE-2 ANNUL-FALSE-2
                    ...])

   TEST is an attribute test that indicates whether this `define_delay'
applies to a particular insn.  If so, the number of required delay
slots is determined by the length of the vector specified as the second
argument.  An insn placed in delay slot N must satisfy attribute test
DELAY-N.  ANNUL-TRUE-N is an attribute test that specifies which insns
may be annulled if the branch is true.  Similarly, ANNUL-FALSE-N
specifies which insns in the delay slot may be annulled if the branch
is false.  If annulling is not supported for that delay slot, `(nil)'
should be coded.

   For example, in the common case where branch and call insns require
a single delay slot, which may contain any insn other than a branch or
call, the following would be placed in the `md' file:

     (define_delay (eq_attr "type" "branch,call")
                   [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)])

   Multiple `define_delay' expressions may be specified.  In this case,
each such expression specifies different delay slot requirements and
there must be no insn for which tests in two `define_delay' expressions
are both true.

   For example, if we have a machine that requires one delay slot for
branches but two for calls,  no delay slot can contain a branch or call
insn, and any valid insn in the delay slot for the branch can be
annulled if the branch is true, we might represent this as follows:

     (define_delay (eq_attr "type" "branch")
        [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call")
         (eq_attr "type" "!branch,call")
         (nil)])

     (define_delay (eq_attr "type" "call")
                   [(eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)
                    (eq_attr "type" "!branch,call") (nil) (nil)])

16.15.8 Specifying Function Units
---------------------------------

On most RISC machines, there are instructions whose results are not
available for a specific number of cycles.  Common cases are
instructions that load data from memory.  On many machines, a pipeline
stall will result if the data is referenced too soon after the load
instruction.

   In addition, many newer microprocessors have multiple function
units, usually one for integer and one for floating point, and often
will incur pipeline stalls when a result that is needed is not yet
ready.

   The descriptions in this section allow the specification of how much
time must elapse between the execution of an instruction and the time
when its result is used.  It also allows specification of when the
execution of an instruction will delay execution of similar instructions
due to function unit conflicts.

   For the purposes of the specifications in this section, a machine is
divided into "function units", each of which execute a specific class
of instructions in first-in-first-out order.  Function units that
accept one instruction each cycle and allow a result to be used in the
succeeding instruction (usually via forwarding) need not be specified.
Classic RISC microprocessors will normally have a single function unit,
which we can call `memory'.  The newer "superscalar" processors will
often have function units for floating point operations, usually at
least a floating point adder and multiplier.

   Each usage of a function units by a class of insns is specified with
a `define_function_unit' expression, which looks like this:

     (define_function_unit NAME MULTIPLICITY SIMULTANEITY
                           TEST READY-DELAY ISSUE-DELAY
                          [CONFLICT-LIST])

   NAME is a string giving the name of the function unit.

   MULTIPLICITY is an integer specifying the number of identical units
in the processor.  If more than one unit is specified, they will be
scheduled independently.  Only truly independent units should be
counted; a pipelined unit should be specified as a single unit.  (The
only common example of a machine that has multiple function units for a
single instruction class that are truly independent and not pipelined
are the two multiply and two increment units of the CDC 6600.)

   SIMULTANEITY specifies the maximum number of insns that can be
executing in each instance of the function unit simultaneously or zero
if the unit is pipelined and has no limit.

   All `define_function_unit' definitions referring to function unit
NAME must have the same name and values for MULTIPLICITY and
SIMULTANEITY.

   TEST is an attribute test that selects the insns we are describing
in this definition.  Note that an insn may use more than one function
unit and a function unit may be specified in more than one
`define_function_unit'.

   READY-DELAY is an integer that specifies the number of cycles after
which the result of the instruction can be used without introducing any
stalls.

   ISSUE-DELAY is an integer that specifies the number of cycles after
the instruction matching the TEST expression begins using this unit
until a subsequent instruction can begin.  A cost of N indicates an N-1
cycle delay.  A subsequent instruction may also be delayed if an
earlier instruction has a longer READY-DELAY value.  This blocking
effect is computed using the SIMULTANEITY, READY-DELAY, ISSUE-DELAY,
and CONFLICT-LIST terms.  For a normal non-pipelined function unit,
SIMULTANEITY is one, the unit is taken to block for the READY-DELAY
cycles of the executing insn, and smaller values of ISSUE-DELAY are
ignored.

   CONFLICT-LIST is an optional list giving detailed conflict costs for
this unit.  If specified, it is a list of condition test expressions to
be applied to insns chosen to execute in NAME following the particular
insn matching TEST that is already executing in NAME.  For each insn in
the list, ISSUE-DELAY specifies the conflict cost; for insns not in the
list, the cost is zero.  If not specified, CONFLICT-LIST defaults to
all instructions that use the function unit.

   Typical uses of this vector are where a floating point function unit
can pipeline either single- or double-precision operations, but not
both, or where a memory unit can pipeline loads, but not stores, etc.

   As an example, consider a classic RISC machine where the result of a
load instruction is not available for two cycles (a single "delay"
instruction is required) and where only one load instruction can be
executed simultaneously.  This would be specified as:

     (define_function_unit "memory" 1 1 (eq_attr "type" "load") 2 0)

   For the case of a floating point function unit that can pipeline
either single or double precision, but not both, the following could be
specified:

     (define_function_unit
        "fp" 1 0 (eq_attr "type" "sp_fp") 4 4 [(eq_attr "type" "dp_fp")])
     (define_function_unit
        "fp" 1 0 (eq_attr "type" "dp_fp") 4 4 [(eq_attr "type" "sp_fp")])

   *Note_* The scheduler attempts to avoid function unit conflicts and
uses all the specifications in the `define_function_unit' expression.
It has recently come to our attention that these specifications may not
allow modeling of some of the newer "superscalar" processors that have
insns using multiple pipelined units.  These insns will cause a
potential conflict for the second unit used during their execution and
there is no way of representing that conflict.  We welcome any examples
of how function unit conflicts work in such processors and suggestions
for their representation.

17.1 Controlling the Compilation Driver, `gcc'
==============================================

You can control the compilation driver.

`SWITCH_TAKES_ARG (CHAR)'
     A C expression which determines whether the option `-CHAR' takes
     arguments.  The value should be the number of arguments that
     option takes-zero, for many options.

     By default, this macro is defined as `DEFAULT_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG',
     which handles the standard options properly.  You need not define
     `SWITCH_TAKES_ARG' unless you wish to add additional options which
     take arguments.  Any redefinition should call
     `DEFAULT_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG' and then check for additional options.

`WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG (NAME)'
     A C expression which determines whether the option `-NAME' takes
     arguments.  The value should be the number of arguments that
     option takes-zero, for many options.  This macro rather than
     `SWITCH_TAKES_ARG' is used for multi-character option names.

     By default, this macro is defined as
     `DEFAULT_WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG', which handles the standard options
     properly.  You need not define `WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG' unless you
     wish to add additional options which take arguments.  Any
     redefinition should call `DEFAULT_WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG' and then
     check for additional options.

`SWITCH_CURTAILS_COMPILATION (CHAR)'
     A C expression which determines whether the option `-CHAR' stops
     compilation before the generation of an executable.  The value is
     boolean, non-zero if the option does stop an executable from being
     generated, zero otherwise.

     By default, this macro is defined as
     `DEFAULT_SWITCH_CURTAILS_COMPILATION', which handles the standard
     options properly.  You need not define
     `SWITCH_CURTAILS_COMPILATION' unless you wish to add additional
     options which affect the generation of an executable.  Any
     redefinition should call `DEFAULT_SWITCH_CURTAILS_COMPILATION' and
     then check for additional options.

`SWITCHES_NEED_SPACES'
     A string-valued C expression which enumerates the options for which
     the linker needs a space between the option and its argument.

     If this macro is not defined, the default value is `""'.

`CPP_SPEC'
     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
     pass to CPP.  It can also specify how to translate options you
     give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the CPP.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

`NO_BUILTIN_SIZE_TYPE'
     If this macro is defined, the preprocessor will not define the
     builtin macro `__SIZE_TYPE__'.  The macro `__SIZE_TYPE__' must
     then be defined by `CPP_SPEC' instead.

     This should be defined if `SIZE_TYPE' depends on target dependent
     flags which are not accessible to the preprocessor.  Otherwise, it
     should not be defined.

`NO_BUILTIN_PTRDIFF_TYPE'
     If this macro is defined, the preprocessor will not define the
     builtin macro `__PTRDIFF_TYPE__'.  The macro `__PTRDIFF_TYPE__'
     must then be defined by `CPP_SPEC' instead.

     This should be defined if `PTRDIFF_TYPE' depends on target
     dependent flags which are not accessible to the preprocessor.
     Otherwise, it should not be defined.

`SIGNED_CHAR_SPEC'
     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
     pass to CPP.  By default, this macro is defined to pass the option
     `-D__CHAR_UNSIGNED__' to CPP if `char' will be treated as
     `unsigned char' by `cc1'.

     Do not define this macro unless you need to override the default
     definition.

`CC1_SPEC'
     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
     pass to `cc1'.  It can also specify how to translate options you
     give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the `cc1'.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

`CC1PLUS_SPEC'
     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
     pass to `cc1plus'.  It can also specify how to translate options
     you give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the
     `cc1plus'.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

`ASM_SPEC'
     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
     pass to the assembler.  It can also specify how to translate
     options you give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the
     assembler.  See the file `sun3.h' for an example of this.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

`ASM_FINAL_SPEC'
     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program how to
     run any programs which cleanup after the normal assembler.
     Normally, this is not needed.  See the file `mips.h' for an
     example of this.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

`LINK_SPEC'
     A C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program options to
     pass to the linker.  It can also specify how to translate options
     you give to GNU CC into options for GNU CC to pass to the linker.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

`LIB_SPEC'
     Another C string constant used much like `LINK_SPEC'.  The
     difference between the two is that `LIB_SPEC' is used at the end
     of the command given to the linker.

     If this macro is not defined, a default is provided that loads the
     standard C library from the usual place.  See `gcc.c'.

`LIBGCC_SPEC'
     Another C string constant that tells the GNU CC driver program how
     and when to place a reference to `libgcc.a' into the linker
     command line.  This constant is placed both before and after the
     value of `LIB_SPEC'.

     If this macro is not defined, the GNU CC driver provides a default
     that passes the string `-lgcc' to the linker unless the `-shared'
     option is specified.

`STARTFILE_SPEC'
     Another C string constant used much like `LINK_SPEC'.  The
     difference between the two is that `STARTFILE_SPEC' is used at the
     very beginning of the command given to the linker.

     If this macro is not defined, a default is provided that loads the
     standard C startup file from the usual place.  See `gcc.c'.

`ENDFILE_SPEC'
     Another C string constant used much like `LINK_SPEC'.  The
     difference between the two is that `ENDFILE_SPEC' is used at the
     very end of the command given to the linker.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

`EXTRA_SPECS'
     Define this macro to provide additional specifications to put in
     the `specs' file that can be used in various specifications like
     `CC1_SPEC'.

     The definition should be an initializer for an array of structures,
     containing a string constant, that defines the specification name,
     and a string constant that provides the specification.

     Do not define this macro if it does not need to do anything.

     `EXTRA_SPECS' is useful when an architecture contains several
     related targets, which have various `..._SPECS' which are similar
     to each other, and the maintainer would like one central place to
     keep these definitions.

     For example, the PowerPC System V.4 targets use `EXTRA_SPECS' to
     define either `_CALL_SYSV' when the System V calling sequence is
     used or `_CALL_AIX' when the older AIX-based calling sequence is
     used.

     The `config/rs6000/rs6000.h' target file defines:

          #define EXTRA_SPECS \
            { "cpp_sysv_default", CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT },

          #define CPP_SYS_DEFAULT ""

     The `config/rs6000/sysv.h' target file defines:
          #undef CPP_SPEC
          #define CPP_SPEC \
          "%{posix: -D_POSIX_SOURCE } \
          %{mcall-sysv: -D_CALL_SYSV } %{mcall-aix: -D_CALL_AIX } \
          %{!mcall-sysv: %{!mcall-aix: %(cpp_sysv_default) }} \
          %{msoft-float: -D_SOFT_FLOAT} %{mcpu=403: -D_SOFT_FLOAT}"

          #undef CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT
          #define CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT "-D_CALL_SYSV"

     while the `config/rs6000/eabiaix.h' target file defines
     `CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT' as:

          #undef CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT
          #define CPP_SYSV_DEFAULT "-D_CALL_AIX"

`LINK_LIBGCC_SPECIAL'
     Define this macro if the driver program should find the library
     `libgcc.a' itself and should not pass `-L' options to the linker.
     If you do not define this macro, the driver program will pass the
     argument `-lgcc' to tell the linker to do the search and will pass
     `-L' options to it.

`LINK_LIBGCC_SPECIAL_1'
     Define this macro if the driver program should find the library
     `libgcc.a'.  If you do not define this macro, the driver program
     will pass the argument `-lgcc' to tell the linker to do the search.
     This macro is similar to `LINK_LIBGCC_SPECIAL', except that it does
     not affect `-L' options.

`LINK_COMMAND_SPEC'
     A C string constant giving the complete command line need to
     execute the linker.  When you do this, you will need to update
     your port each time a change is made to the link command line
     within `gcc.c'.  Therefore, define this macro only if you need to
     completely redefine the command line for invoking the linker and
     there is no other way to accomplish the effect you need.

`MULTILIB_DEFAULTS'
     Define this macro as a C expression for the initializer of an
     array of string to tell the driver program which options are
     defaults for this target and thus do not need to be handled
     specially when using `MULTILIB_OPTIONS'.

     Do not define this macro if `MULTILIB_OPTIONS' is not defined in
     the target makefile fragment or if none of the options listed in
     `MULTILIB_OPTIONS' are set by default.  *Note Target Fragment::.

`RELATIVE_PREFIX_NOT_LINKDIR'
     Define this macro to tell `gcc' that it should only translate a
     `-B' prefix into a `-L' linker option if the prefix indicates an
     absolute file name.

`STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX'
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override
     the standard choice of `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/' as the default
     prefix to try when searching for the executable files of the
     compiler.

`MD_EXEC_PREFIX'
     If defined, this macro is an additional prefix to try after
     `STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX'.  `MD_EXEC_PREFIX' is not searched when the
     `-b' option is used, or the compiler is built as a cross compiler.
     If you define `MD_EXEC_PREFIX', then be sure to add it to the list
     of directories used to find the assembler in `configure.in'.

`STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX'
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override
     the standard choice of `/usr/local/lib/' as the default prefix to
     try when searching for startup files such as `crt0.o'.

`MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX'
     If defined, this macro supplies an additional prefix to try after
     the standard prefixes.  `MD_EXEC_PREFIX' is not searched when the
     `-b' option is used, or when the compiler is built as a cross
     compiler.

`MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX_1'
     If defined, this macro supplies yet another prefix to try after the
     standard prefixes.  It is not searched when the `-b' option is
     used, or when the compiler is built as a cross compiler.

`INIT_ENVIRONMENT'
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to set
     environment variables for programs called by the driver, such as
     the assembler and loader.  The driver passes the value of this
     macro to `putenv' to initialize the necessary environment
     variables.

`LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR'
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override
     the standard choice of `/usr/local/include' as the default prefix
     to try when searching for local header files.  `LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR'
     comes before `SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR' in the search order.

     Cross compilers do not use this macro and do not search either
     `/usr/local/include' or its replacement.

`SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR'
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to specify a
     system-specific directory to search for header files before the
     standard directory.  `SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR' comes before
     `STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR' in the search order.

     Cross compilers do not use this macro and do not search the
     directory specified.

`STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR'
     Define this macro as a C string constant if you wish to override
     the standard choice of `/usr/include' as the default prefix to try
     when searching for header files.

     Cross compilers do not use this macro and do not search either
     `/usr/include' or its replacement.

`STANDARD_INCLUDE_COMPONENT'
     The "component" corresponding to `STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR'.  See
     `INCLUDE_DEFAULTS', below, for the description of components.  If
     you do not define this macro, no component is used.

`INCLUDE_DEFAULTS'
     Define this macro if you wish to override the entire default
     search path for include files.  For a native compiler, the default
     search path usually consists of `GCC_INCLUDE_DIR',
     `LOCAL_INCLUDE_DIR', `SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIR',
     `GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR', and `STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIR'.  In addition,
     `GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR' and `GCC_INCLUDE_DIR' are defined
     automatically by `Makefile', and specify private search areas for
     GCC.  The directory `GPLUSPLUS_INCLUDE_DIR' is used only for C++
     programs.

     The definition should be an initializer for an array of structures.
     Each array element should have four elements: the directory name (a
     string constant), the component name, and flag for C++-only
     directories, and a flag showing that the includes in the directory
     don't need to be wrapped in `extern `C'' when compiling C++.  Mark
     the end of the array with a null element.

     The component name denotes what GNU package the include file is
     part of, if any, in all upper-case letters.  For example, it might
     be `GCC' or `BINUTILS'.  If the package is part of the a
     vendor-supplied operating system, code the component name as `0'.

     For example, here is the definition used for VAX/VMS:

          #define INCLUDE_DEFAULTS \
          {                                       \
            { "GNU_GXX_INCLUDE:", "G++", 1, 1},   \
            { "GNU_CC_INCLUDE:", "GCC", 0, 0},    \
            { "SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSLIB.]", 0, 0, 0},  \
            { ".", 0, 0, 0},                      \
            { 0, 0, 0, 0}                         \
          }

   Here is the order of prefixes tried for exec files:

  1. Any prefixes specified by the user with `-B'.

  2. The environment variable `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX', if any.

  3. The directories specified by the environment variable
     `COMPILER_PATH'.

  4. The macro `STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX'.

  5. `/usr/lib/gcc/'.

  6. The macro `MD_EXEC_PREFIX', if any.

   Here is the order of prefixes tried for startfiles:

  1. Any prefixes specified by the user with `-B'.

  2. The environment variable `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX', if any.

  3. The directories specified by the environment variable
     `LIBRARY_PATH' (native only, cross compilers do not use this).

  4. The macro `STANDARD_EXEC_PREFIX'.

  5. `/usr/lib/gcc/'.

  6. The macro `MD_EXEC_PREFIX', if any.

  7. The macro `MD_STARTFILE_PREFIX', if any.

  8. The macro `STANDARD_STARTFILE_PREFIX'.

  9. `/lib/'.

 10. `/usr/lib/'.

17.2 Run-time Target Specification
==================================

Here are run-time target specifications.

`CPP_PREDEFINES'
     Define this to be a string constant containing `-D' options to
     define the predefined macros that identify this machine and system.
     These macros will be predefined unless the `-ansi' option is
     specified.

     In addition, a parallel set of macros are predefined, whose names
     are made by appending `__' at the beginning and at the end.  These
     `__' macros are permitted by the ANSI standard, so they are
     predefined regardless of whether `-ansi' is specified.

     For example, on the Sun, one can use the following value:

          "-Dmc68000 -Dsun -Dunix"

     The result is to define the macros `__mc68000__', `__sun__' and
     `__unix__' unconditionally, and the macros `mc68000', `sun' and
     `unix' provided `-ansi' is not specified.

`extern int target_flags;'
     This declaration should be present.

`TARGET_...'
     This series of macros is to allow compiler command arguments to
     enable or disable the use of optional features of the target
     machine.  For example, one machine description serves both the
     68000 and the 68020; a command argument tells the compiler whether
     it should use 68020-only instructions or not.  This command
     argument works by means of a macro `TARGET_68020' that tests a bit
     in `target_flags'.

     Define a macro `TARGET_FEATURENAME' for each such option.  Its
     definition should test a bit in `target_flags'; for example:

          #define TARGET_68020 (target_flags & 1)

     One place where these macros are used is in the
     condition-expressions of instruction patterns.  Note how
     `TARGET_68020' appears frequently in the 68000 machine description
     file, `m68k.md'.  Another place they are used is in the
     definitions of the other macros in the `MACHINE.h' file.

`TARGET_SWITCHES'
     This macro defines names of command options to set and clear bits
     in `target_flags'.  Its definition is an initializer with a
     subgrouping for each command option.

     Each subgrouping contains a string constant, that defines the
     option name, a number, which contains the bits to set in
     `target_flags', and a second string which is the description
     displayed by -help.  If the number is negative then the bits
     specified by the number are cleared instead of being set.  If the
     description string is present but empty, then no help information
     will be displayed for that option, but it will not count as an
     undocumented option.  The actual option name is made by appending
     `-m' to the specified name.

     One of the subgroupings should have a null string.  The number in
     this grouping is the default value for `target_flags'.  Any target
     options act starting with that value.

     Here is an example which defines `-m68000' and `-m68020' with
     opposite meanings, and picks the latter as the default:

          #define TARGET_SWITCHES \
            { { "68020", 1, "" },      \
              { "68000", -1, "Compile for the 68000" }, \
              { "", 1, "" }}

`TARGET_OPTIONS'
     This macro is similar to `TARGET_SWITCHES' but defines names of
     command options that have values.  Its definition is an
     initializer with a subgrouping for each command option.

     Each subgrouping contains a string constant, that defines the
     fixed part of the option name, the address of a variable, and a
     description string.  The variable, type `char *', is set to the
     variable part of the given option if the fixed part matches.  The
     actual option name is made by appending `-m' to the specified name.

     Here is an example which defines `-mshort-data-NUMBER'.  If the
     given option is `-mshort-data-512', the variable `m88k_short_data'
     will be set to the string `"512"'.

          extern char *m88k_short_data;
          #define TARGET_OPTIONS \
           { { "short-data-", &m88k_short_data, "Specify the size of the short data section" } }

`TARGET_VERSION'
     This macro is a C statement to print on `stderr' a string
     describing the particular machine description choice.  Every
     machine description should define `TARGET_VERSION'.  For example:

          #ifdef MOTOROLA
          #define TARGET_VERSION \
            fprintf (stderr, " (68k, Motorola syntax)");
          #else
          #define TARGET_VERSION \
            fprintf (stderr, " (68k, MIT syntax)");
          #endif

`OVERRIDE_OPTIONS'
     Sometimes certain combinations of command options do not make
     sense on a particular target machine.  You can define a macro
     `OVERRIDE_OPTIONS' to take account of this.  This macro, if
     defined, is executed once just after all the command options have
     been parsed.

     Don't use this macro to turn on various extra optimizations for
     `-O'.  That is what `OPTIMIZATION_OPTIONS' is for.

`OPTIMIZATION_OPTIONS (LEVEL, SIZE)'
     Some machines may desire to change what optimizations are
     performed for various optimization levels.   This macro, if
     defined, is executed once just after the optimization level is
     determined and before the remainder of the command options have
     been parsed.  Values set in this macro are used as the default
     values for the other command line options.

     LEVEL is the optimization level specified; 2 if `-O2' is
     specified, 1 if `-O' is specified, and 0 if neither is specified.

     SIZE is non-zero if `-Os' is specified and zero otherwise.

     You should not use this macro to change options that are not
     machine-specific.  These should uniformly selected by the same
     optimization level on all supported machines.  Use this macro to
     enable machine-specific optimizations.

     *Do not examine `write_symbols' in this macro!* The debugging
     options are not supposed to alter the generated code.

`CAN_DEBUG_WITHOUT_FP'
     Define this macro if debugging can be performed even without a
     frame pointer.  If this macro is defined, GNU CC will turn on the
     `-fomit-frame-pointer' option whenever `-O' is specified.

17.3 Storage Layout
===================

Note that the definitions of the macros in this table which are sizes or
alignments measured in bits do not need to be constant.  They can be C
expressions that refer to static variables, such as the `target_flags'.
*Note Run-time Target::.

`BITS_BIG_ENDIAN'
     Define this macro to have the value 1 if the most significant bit
     in a byte has the lowest number; otherwise define it to have the
     value zero.  This means that bit-field instructions count from the
     most significant bit.  If the machine has no bit-field
     instructions, then this must still be defined, but it doesn't
     matter which value it is defined to.  This macro need not be a
     constant.

     This macro does not affect the way structure fields are packed into
     bytes or words; that is controlled by `BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN'.

`BYTES_BIG_ENDIAN'
     Define this macro to have the value 1 if the most significant byte
     in a word has the lowest number.  This macro need not be a
     constant.

`WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'
     Define this macro to have the value 1 if, in a multiword object,
     the most significant word has the lowest number.  This applies to
     both memory locations and registers; GNU CC fundamentally assumes
     that the order of words in memory is the same as the order in
     registers.  This macro need not be a constant.

`LIBGCC2_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'
     Define this macro if WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN is not constant.  This must
     be a constant value with the same meaning as WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN,
     which will be used only when compiling libgcc2.c.  Typically the
     value will be set based on preprocessor defines.

`FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'
     Define this macro to have the value 1 if `DFmode', `XFmode' or
     `TFmode' floating point numbers are stored in memory with the word
     containing the sign bit at the lowest address; otherwise define it
     to have the value 0.  This macro need not be a constant.

     You need not define this macro if the ordering is the same as for
     multi-word integers.

`BITS_PER_UNIT'
     Define this macro to be the number of bits in an addressable
     storage unit (byte); normally 8.

`BITS_PER_WORD'
     Number of bits in a word; normally 32.

`MAX_BITS_PER_WORD'
     Maximum number of bits in a word.  If this is undefined, the
     default is `BITS_PER_WORD'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value
     that is the largest value that `BITS_PER_WORD' can have at
     run-time.

`UNITS_PER_WORD'
     Number of storage units in a word; normally 4.

`MIN_UNITS_PER_WORD'
     Minimum number of units in a word.  If this is undefined, the
     default is `UNITS_PER_WORD'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value
     that is the smallest value that `UNITS_PER_WORD' can have at
     run-time.

`POINTER_SIZE'
     Width of a pointer, in bits.  You must specify a value no wider
     than the width of `Pmode'.  If it is not equal to the width of
     `Pmode', you must define `POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED'.

`POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED'
     A C expression whose value is nonzero if pointers that need to be
     extended from being `POINTER_SIZE' bits wide to `Pmode' are to be
     zero-extended and zero if they are to be sign-extended.

     You need not define this macro if the `POINTER_SIZE' is equal to
     the width of `Pmode'.

`PROMOTE_MODE (M, UNSIGNEDP, TYPE)'
     A macro to update M and UNSIGNEDP when an object whose type is
     TYPE and which has the specified mode and signedness is to be
     stored in a register.  This macro is only called when TYPE is a
     scalar type.

     On most RISC machines, which only have operations that operate on
     a full register, define this macro to set M to `word_mode' if M is
     an integer mode narrower than `BITS_PER_WORD'.  In most cases,
     only integer modes should be widened because wider-precision
     floating-point operations are usually more expensive than their
     narrower counterparts.

     For most machines, the macro definition does not change UNSIGNEDP.
     However, some machines, have instructions that preferentially
     handle either signed or unsigned quantities of certain modes.  For
     example, on the DEC Alpha, 32-bit loads from memory and 32-bit add
     instructions sign-extend the result to 64 bits.  On such machines,
     set UNSIGNEDP according to which kind of extension is more
     efficient.

     Do not define this macro if it would never modify M.

`PROMOTE_FUNCTION_ARGS'
     Define this macro if the promotion described by `PROMOTE_MODE'
     should also be done for outgoing function arguments.

`PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN'
     Define this macro if the promotion described by `PROMOTE_MODE'
     should also be done for the return value of functions.

     If this macro is defined, `FUNCTION_VALUE' must perform the same
     promotions done by `PROMOTE_MODE'.

`PROMOTE_FOR_CALL_ONLY'
     Define this macro if the promotion described by `PROMOTE_MODE'
     should _only_ be performed for outgoing function arguments or
     function return values, as specified by `PROMOTE_FUNCTION_ARGS'
     and `PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN', respectively.

`PARM_BOUNDARY'
     Normal alignment required for function parameters on the stack, in
     bits.  All stack parameters receive at least this much alignment
     regardless of data type.  On most machines, this is the same as the
     size of an integer.

`STACK_BOUNDARY'
     Define this macro if there is a guaranteed alignment for the stack
     pointer on this machine.  The definition is a C expression for the
     desired alignment (measured in bits).  This value is used as a
     default if PREFERRED_STACK_BOUNDARY is not defined.

`PREFERRED_STACK_BOUNDARY'
     Define this macro if you wish to preserve a certain alignment for
     the stack pointer.  The definition is a C expression for the
     desired alignment (measured in bits).  If STACK_BOUNDARY is also
     defined, this macro must evaluate to a value equal to or larger
     than STACK_BOUNDARY.

     If `PUSH_ROUNDING' is not defined, the stack will always be aligned
     to the specified boundary.  If `PUSH_ROUNDING' is defined and
     specifies a less strict alignment than `PREFERRED_STACK_BOUNDARY',
     the stack may be momentarily unaligned while pushing arguments.

`FUNCTION_BOUNDARY'
     Alignment required for a function entry point, in bits.

`BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'
     Biggest alignment that any data type can require on this machine,
     in bits.

`MINIMUM_ATOMIC_ALIGNMENT'
     If defined, the smallest alignment, in bits, that can be given to
     an object that can be referenced in one operation, without
     disturbing any nearby object.  Normally, this is `BITS_PER_UNIT',
     but may be larger on machines that don't have byte or half-word
     store operations.

`BIGGEST_FIELD_ALIGNMENT'
     Biggest alignment that any structure field can require on this
     machine, in bits.  If defined, this overrides `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'
     for structure fields only.

`ADJUST_FIELD_ALIGN (FIELD, COMPUTED)'
     An expression for the alignment of a structure field FIELD if the
     alignment computed in the usual way is COMPUTED.  GNU CC uses this
     value instead of the value in `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT' or
     `BIGGEST_FIELD_ALIGNMENT', if defined, for structure fields only.

`MAX_OFILE_ALIGNMENT'
     Biggest alignment supported by the object file format of this
     machine.  Use this macro to limit the alignment which can be
     specified using the `__attribute__ ((aligned (N)))' construct.  If
     not defined, the default value is `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'.

`DATA_ALIGNMENT (TYPE, BASIC-ALIGN)'
     If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment for a
     variables in the static store.  TYPE is the data type, and
     BASIC-ALIGN is the alignment that the object would ordinarily
     have.  The value of this macro is used instead of that alignment
     to align the object.

     If this macro is not defined, then BASIC-ALIGN is used.

     One use of this macro is to increase alignment of medium-size data
     to make it all fit in fewer cache lines.  Another is to cause
     character arrays to be word-aligned so that `strcpy' calls that
     copy constants to character arrays can be done inline.

`CONSTANT_ALIGNMENT (CONSTANT, BASIC-ALIGN)'
     If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment given to a
     constant that is being placed in memory.  CONSTANT is the constant
     and BASIC-ALIGN is the alignment that the object would ordinarily
     have.  The value of this macro is used instead of that alignment to
     align the object.

     If this macro is not defined, then BASIC-ALIGN is used.

     The typical use of this macro is to increase alignment for string
     constants to be word aligned so that `strcpy' calls that copy
     constants can be done inline.

`LOCAL_ALIGNMENT (TYPE, BASIC-ALIGN)'
     If defined, a C expression to compute the alignment for a
     variables in the local store.  TYPE is the data type, and
     BASIC-ALIGN is the alignment that the object would ordinarily
     have.  The value of this macro is used instead of that alignment
     to align the object.

     If this macro is not defined, then BASIC-ALIGN is used.

     One use of this macro is to increase alignment of medium-size data
     to make it all fit in fewer cache lines.

`EMPTY_FIELD_BOUNDARY'
     Alignment in bits to be given to a structure bit field that
     follows an empty field such as `int : 0;'.

     Note that `PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS' also affects the alignment
     that results from an empty field.

`STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY'
     Number of bits which any structure or union's size must be a
     multiple of.  Each structure or union's size is rounded up to a
     multiple of this.

     If you do not define this macro, the default is the same as
     `BITS_PER_UNIT'.

`STRICT_ALIGNMENT'
     Define this macro to be the value 1 if instructions will fail to
     work if given data not on the nominal alignment.  If instructions
     will merely go slower in that case, define this macro as 0.

`PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS'
     Define this if you wish to imitate the way many other C compilers
     handle alignment of bitfields and the structures that contain them.

     The behavior is that the type written for a bitfield (`int',
     `short', or other integer type) imposes an alignment for the
     entire structure, as if the structure really did contain an
     ordinary field of that type.  In addition, the bitfield is placed
     within the structure so that it would fit within such a field, not
     crossing a boundary for it.

     Thus, on most machines, a bitfield whose type is written as `int'
     would not cross a four-byte boundary, and would force four-byte
     alignment for the whole structure.  (The alignment used may not be
     four bytes; it is controlled by the other alignment parameters.)

     If the macro is defined, its definition should be a C expression;
     a nonzero value for the expression enables this behavior.

     Note that if this macro is not defined, or its value is zero, some
     bitfields may cross more than one alignment boundary.  The
     compiler can support such references if there are `insv', `extv',
     and `extzv' insns that can directly reference memory.

     The other known way of making bitfields work is to define
     `STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY' as large as `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'.  Then
     every structure can be accessed with fullwords.

     Unless the machine has bitfield instructions or you define
     `STRUCTURE_SIZE_BOUNDARY' that way, you must define
     `PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS' to have a nonzero value.

     If your aim is to make GNU CC use the same conventions for laying
     out bitfields as are used by another compiler, here is how to
     investigate what the other compiler does.  Compile and run this
     program:

          struct foo1
          {
            char x;
            char :0;
            char y;
          };

          struct foo2
          {
            char x;
            int :0;
            char y;
          };

          main ()
          {
            printf ("Size of foo1 is %d\n",
                    sizeof (struct foo1));
            printf ("Size of foo2 is %d\n",
                    sizeof (struct foo2));
            exit (0);
          }

     If this prints 2 and 5, then the compiler's behavior is what you
     would get from `PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS'.

`BITFIELD_NBYTES_LIMITED'
     Like PCC_BITFIELD_TYPE_MATTERS except that its effect is limited to
     aligning a bitfield within the structure.

`ROUND_TYPE_SIZE (TYPE, COMPUTED, SPECIFIED)'
     Define this macro as an expression for the overall size of a type
     (given by TYPE as a tree node) when the size computed in the usual
     way is COMPUTED and the alignment is SPECIFIED.

     The default is to round COMPUTED up to a multiple of SPECIFIED.

`ROUND_TYPE_ALIGN (TYPE, COMPUTED, SPECIFIED)'
     Define this macro as an expression for the alignment of a type
     (given by TYPE as a tree node) if the alignment computed in the
     usual way is COMPUTED and the alignment explicitly specified was
     SPECIFIED.

     The default is to use SPECIFIED if it is larger; otherwise, use
     the smaller of COMPUTED and `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'

`MAX_FIXED_MODE_SIZE'
     An integer expression for the size in bits of the largest integer
     machine mode that should actually be used.  All integer machine
     modes of this size or smaller can be used for structures and
     unions with the appropriate sizes.  If this macro is undefined,
     `GET_MODE_BITSIZE (DImode)' is assumed.

`STACK_SAVEAREA_MODE (SAVE_LEVEL)'
     If defined, an expression of type `enum machine_mode' that
     specifies the mode of the save area operand of a
     `save_stack_LEVEL' named pattern (*note Standard Names::).
     SAVE_LEVEL is one of `SAVE_BLOCK', `SAVE_FUNCTION', or
     `SAVE_NONLOCAL' and selects which of the three named patterns is
     having its mode specified.

     You need not define this macro if it always returns `Pmode'.  You
     would most commonly define this macro if the `save_stack_LEVEL'
     patterns need to support both a 32- and a 64-bit mode.

`STACK_SIZE_MODE'
     If defined, an expression of type `enum machine_mode' that
     specifies the mode of the size increment operand of an
     `allocate_stack' named pattern (*note Standard Names::).

     You need not define this macro if it always returns `word_mode'.
     You would most commonly define this macro if the `allocate_stack'
     pattern needs to support both a 32- and a 64-bit mode.

`CHECK_FLOAT_VALUE (MODE, VALUE, OVERFLOW)'
     A C statement to validate the value VALUE (of type `double') for
     mode MODE.  This means that you check whether VALUE fits within
     the possible range of values for mode MODE on this target machine.
     The mode MODE is always a mode of class `MODE_FLOAT'.  OVERFLOW is
     nonzero if the value is already known to be out of range.

     If VALUE is not valid or if OVERFLOW is nonzero, you should set
     OVERFLOW to 1 and then assign some valid value to VALUE.  Allowing
     an invalid value to go through the compiler can produce incorrect
     assembler code which may even cause Unix assemblers to crash.

     This macro need not be defined if there is no work for it to do.

`TARGET_FLOAT_FORMAT'
     A code distinguishing the floating point format of the target
     machine.  There are three defined values:

    `IEEE_FLOAT_FORMAT'
          This code indicates IEEE floating point.  It is the default;
          there is no need to define this macro when the format is IEEE.

    `VAX_FLOAT_FORMAT'
          This code indicates the peculiar format used on the Vax.

    `UNKNOWN_FLOAT_FORMAT'
          This code indicates any other format.

     The value of this macro is compared with `HOST_FLOAT_FORMAT'
     (*note Config::) to determine whether the target machine has the
     same format as the host machine.  If any other formats are
     actually in use on supported machines, new codes should be defined
     for them.

     The ordering of the component words of floating point values
     stored in memory is controlled by `FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN' for the
     target machine and `HOST_FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN' for the host.

`DEFAULT_VTABLE_THUNKS'
     GNU CC supports two ways of implementing C++ vtables:  traditional
     or with so-called "thunks".  The flag `-fvtable-thunk' chooses
     between them.  Define this macro to be a C expression for the
     default value of that flag.  If `DEFAULT_VTABLE_THUNKS' is 0, GNU
     CC uses the traditional implementation by default.  The "thunk"
     implementation is more efficient (especially if you have provided
     an implementation of `ASM_OUTPUT_MI_THUNK', see *note Function
     Entry::), but is not binary compatible with code compiled using
     the traditional implementation.  If you are writing a new ports,
     define `DEFAULT_VTABLE_THUNKS' to 1.

     If you do not define this macro, the default for `-fvtable-thunk'
     is 0.

17.4 Layout of Source Language Data Types
=========================================

These macros define the sizes and other characteristics of the standard
basic data types used in programs being compiled.  Unlike the macros in
the previous section, these apply to specific features of C and related
languages, rather than to fundamental aspects of storage layout.

`INT_TYPE_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `int' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.

`MAX_INT_TYPE_SIZE'
     Maximum number for the size in bits of the type `int' on the target
     machine.  If this is undefined, the default is `INT_TYPE_SIZE'.
     Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the largest value that
     `INT_TYPE_SIZE' can have at run-time.  This is used in `cpp'.

`SHORT_TYPE_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `short' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is half a
     word.  (If this would be less than one storage unit, it is rounded
     up to one unit.)

`LONG_TYPE_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `long' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.

`MAX_LONG_TYPE_SIZE'
     Maximum number for the size in bits of the type `long' on the
     target machine.  If this is undefined, the default is
     `LONG_TYPE_SIZE'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
     largest value that `LONG_TYPE_SIZE' can have at run-time.  This is
     used in `cpp'.

`LONG_LONG_TYPE_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `long long' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
     words.  If you want to support GNU Ada on your machine, the value
     of macro must be at least 64.

`CHAR_TYPE_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `char' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one
     quarter of a word.  (If this would be less than one storage unit,
     it is rounded up to one unit.)

`MAX_CHAR_TYPE_SIZE'
     Maximum number for the size in bits of the type `char' on the
     target machine.  If this is undefined, the default is
     `CHAR_TYPE_SIZE'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
     largest value that `CHAR_TYPE_SIZE' can have at run-time.  This is
     used in `cpp'.

`FLOAT_TYPE_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `float' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is one word.

`DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `double' on the
     target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
     words.

`LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bits of the type `long double' on
     the target machine.  If you don't define this, the default is two
     words.

`WIDEST_HARDWARE_FP_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bits of the widest floating-point
     format supported by the hardware.  If you define this macro, you
     must specify a value less than or equal to the value of
     `LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE'.  If you do not define this macro, the
     value of `LONG_DOUBLE_TYPE_SIZE' is the default.

`DEFAULT_SIGNED_CHAR'
     An expression whose value is 1 or 0, according to whether the type
     `char' should be signed or unsigned by default.  The user can
     always override this default with the options `-fsigned-char' and
     `-funsigned-char'.

`DEFAULT_SHORT_ENUMS'
     A C expression to determine whether to give an `enum' type only as
     many bytes as it takes to represent the range of possible values
     of that type.  A nonzero value means to do that; a zero value
     means all `enum' types should be allocated like `int'.

     If you don't define the macro, the default is 0.

`SIZE_TYPE'
     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type
     to use for size values.  The typedef name `size_t' is defined
     using the contents of the string.

     The string can contain more than one keyword.  If so, separate
     them with spaces, and write first any length keyword, then
     `unsigned' if appropriate, and finally `int'.  The string must
     exactly match one of the data type names defined in the function
     `init_decl_processing' in the file `c-decl.c'.  You may not omit
     `int' or change the order--that would cause the compiler to crash
     on startup.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is `"long unsigned
     int"'.

`PTRDIFF_TYPE'
     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type
     to use for the result of subtracting two pointers.  The typedef
     name `ptrdiff_t' is defined using the contents of the string.  See
     `SIZE_TYPE' above for more information.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is `"long int"'.

`WCHAR_TYPE'
     A C expression for a string describing the name of the data type
     to use for wide characters.  The typedef name `wchar_t' is defined
     using the contents of the string.  See `SIZE_TYPE' above for more
     information.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is `"int"'.

`WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bits of the data type for wide
     characters.  This is used in `cpp', which cannot make use of
     `WCHAR_TYPE'.

`MAX_WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE'
     Maximum number for the size in bits of the data type for wide
     characters.  If this is undefined, the default is
     `WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
     largest value that `WCHAR_TYPE_SIZE' can have at run-time.  This is
     used in `cpp'.

`OBJC_INT_SELECTORS'
     Define this macro if the type of Objective C selectors should be
     `int'.

     If this macro is not defined, then selectors should have the type
     `struct objc_selector *'.

`OBJC_SELECTORS_WITHOUT_LABELS'
     Define this macro if the compiler can group all the selectors
     together into a vector and use just one label at the beginning of
     the vector.  Otherwise, the compiler must give each selector its
     own assembler label.

     On certain machines, it is important to have a separate label for
     each selector because this enables the linker to eliminate
     duplicate selectors.

`TARGET_BELL'
     A C constant expression for the integer value for escape sequence
     `\a'.

`TARGET_BS'
`TARGET_TAB'
`TARGET_NEWLINE'
     C constant expressions for the integer values for escape sequences
     `\b', `\t' and `\n'.

`TARGET_VT'
`TARGET_FF'
`TARGET_CR'
     C constant expressions for the integer values for escape sequences
     `\v', `\f' and `\r'.

File: gcc.info,  Node: Register Basics,  Next: Allocation Order,  Up: Registers

17.5.1 Basic Characteristics of Registers
-----------------------------------------

Registers have various characteristics.

`FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER'
     Number of hardware registers known to the compiler.  They receive
     numbers 0 through `FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER-1'; thus, the first
     pseudo register's number really is assigned the number
     `FIRST_PSEUDO_REGISTER'.

`FIXED_REGISTERS'
     An initializer that says which registers are used for fixed
     purposes all throughout the compiled code and are therefore not
     available for general allocation.  These would include the stack
     pointer, the frame pointer (except on machines where that can be
     used as a general register when no frame pointer is needed), the
     program counter on machines where that is considered one of the
     addressable registers, and any other numbered register with a
     standard use.

     This information is expressed as a sequence of numbers, separated
     by commas and surrounded by braces.  The Nth number is 1 if
     register N is fixed, 0 otherwise.

     The table initialized from this macro, and the table initialized by
     the following one, may be overridden at run time either
     automatically, by the actions of the macro
     `CONDITIONAL_REGISTER_USAGE', or by the user with the command
     options `-ffixed-REG', `-fcall-used-REG' and `-fcall-saved-REG'.

`CALL_USED_REGISTERS'
     Like `FIXED_REGISTERS' but has 1 for each register that is
     clobbered (in general) by function calls as well as for fixed
     registers.  This macro therefore identifies the registers that are
     not available for general allocation of values that must live
     across function calls.

     If a register has 0 in `CALL_USED_REGISTERS', the compiler
     automatically saves it on function entry and restores it on
     function exit, if the register is used within the function.

`HARD_REGNO_CALL_PART_CLOBBERED (REGNO, MODE)'
     A C expression that is non-zero if it is not permissible to store a
     value of mode MODE in hard register number REGNO across a call
     without some part of it being clobbered.  For most machines this
     macro need not be defined.  It is only required for machines that
     do not preserve the entire contents of a register across a call.

`CONDITIONAL_REGISTER_USAGE'
     Zero or more C statements that may conditionally modify four
     variables `fixed_regs', `call_used_regs', `global_regs' (these
     three are of type `char []') and `reg_class_contents' (of type
     `HARD_REG_SET').  Before the macro is called `fixed_regs',
     `call_used_regs' and `reg_class_contents' have been initialized
     from `FIXED_REGISTERS', `CALL_USED_REGISTERS' and
     `REG_CLASS_CONTENTS', respectively, `global_regs' has been
     cleared, and any `-ffixed-REG', `-fcall-used-REG' and
     `-fcall-saved-REG' command options have been applied.

     This is necessary in case the fixed or call-clobbered registers
     depend on target flags.

     You need not define this macro if it has no work to do.

     If the usage of an entire class of registers depends on the target
     flags, you may indicate this to GCC by using this macro to modify
     `fixed_regs' and `call_used_regs' to 1 for each of the registers
     in the classes which should not be used by GCC.  Also define the
     macro `REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER' to return `NO_REGS' if it is called
     with a letter for a class that shouldn't be used.

     (However, if this class is not included in `GENERAL_REGS' and all
     of the insn patterns whose constraints permit this class are
     controlled by target switches, then GCC will automatically avoid
     using these registers when the target switches are opposed to
     them.)

`NON_SAVING_SETJMP'
     If this macro is defined and has a nonzero value, it means that
     `setjmp' and related functions fail to save the registers, or that
     `longjmp' fails to restore them.  To compensate, the compiler
     avoids putting variables in registers in functions that use
     `setjmp'.

`INCOMING_REGNO (OUT)'
     Define this macro if the target machine has register windows.
     This C expression returns the register number as seen by the
     called function corresponding to the register number OUT as seen
     by the calling function.  Return OUT if register number OUT is not
     an outbound register.

`OUTGOING_REGNO (IN)'
     Define this macro if the target machine has register windows.
     This C expression returns the register number as seen by the
     calling function corresponding to the register number IN as seen
     by the called function.  Return IN if register number IN is not an
     inbound register.



File: gcc.info,  Node: Allocation Order,  Next: Values in Registers,  Prev: Register Basics,  Up: Registers

17.5.2 Order of Allocation of Registers
---------------------------------------

Registers are allocated in order.

`REG_ALLOC_ORDER'
     If defined, an initializer for a vector of integers, containing the
     numbers of hard registers in the order in which GNU CC should
     prefer to use them (from most preferred to least).

     If this macro is not defined, registers are used lowest numbered
     first (all else being equal).

     One use of this macro is on machines where the highest numbered
     registers must always be saved and the save-multiple-registers
     instruction supports only sequences of consecutive registers.  On
     such machines, define `REG_ALLOC_ORDER' to be an initializer that
     lists the highest numbered allocable register first.

`ORDER_REGS_FOR_LOCAL_ALLOC'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to choose the order in which to
     allocate hard registers for pseudo-registers local to a basic
     block.

     Store the desired register order in the array `reg_alloc_order'.
     Element 0 should be the register to allocate first; element 1, the
     next register; and so on.

     The macro body should not assume anything about the contents of
     `reg_alloc_order' before execution of the macro.

     On most machines, it is not necessary to define this macro.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Values in Registers,  Next: Leaf Functions,  Prev: Allocation Order,  Up: Registers

17.5.3 How Values Fit in Registers
----------------------------------

This section discusses the macros that describe which kinds of values
(specifically, which machine modes) each register can hold, and how many
consecutive registers are needed for a given mode.

`HARD_REGNO_NREGS (REGNO, MODE)'
     A C expression for the number of consecutive hard registers,
     starting at register number REGNO, required to hold a value of mode
     MODE.

     On a machine where all registers are exactly one word, a suitable
     definition of this macro is

          #define HARD_REGNO_NREGS(REGNO, MODE)            \
             ((GET_MODE_SIZE (MODE) + UNITS_PER_WORD - 1)  \
              / UNITS_PER_WORD))

`ALTER_HARD_SUBREG (TGT_MODE, WORD, SRC_MODE, REGNO)'
     A C expression that returns an adjusted hard register number for

          (subreg:TGT_MODE (reg:SRC_MODE REGNO) WORD)

     This may be needed if the target machine has mixed sized big-endian
     registers, like Sparc v9.

`HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (REGNO, MODE)'
     A C expression that is nonzero if it is permissible to store a
     value of mode MODE in hard register number REGNO (or in several
     registers starting with that one).  For a machine where all
     registers are equivalent, a suitable definition is

          #define HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK(REGNO, MODE) 1

     You need not include code to check for the numbers of fixed
     registers, because the allocation mechanism considers them to be
     always occupied.

     On some machines, double-precision values must be kept in even/odd
     register pairs.  You can implement that by defining this macro to
     reject odd register numbers for such modes.

     The minimum requirement for a mode to be OK in a register is that
     the `movMODE' instruction pattern support moves between the
     register and other hard register in the same class and that moving
     a value into the register and back out not alter it.

     Since the same instruction used to move `word_mode' will work for
     all narrower integer modes, it is not necessary on any machine for
     `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK' to distinguish between these modes, provided
     you define patterns `movhi', etc., to take advantage of this.  This
     is useful because of the interaction between `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'
     and `MODES_TIEABLE_P'; it is very desirable for all integer modes
     to be tieable.

     Many machines have special registers for floating point arithmetic.
     Often people assume that floating point machine modes are allowed
     only in floating point registers.  This is not true.  Any
     registers that can hold integers can safely _hold_ a floating
     point machine mode, whether or not floating arithmetic can be done
     on it in those registers.  Integer move instructions can be used
     to move the values.

     On some machines, though, the converse is true: fixed-point machine
     modes may not go in floating registers.  This is true if the
     floating registers normalize any value stored in them, because
     storing a non-floating value there would garble it.  In this case,
     `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK' should reject fixed-point machine modes in
     floating registers.  But if the floating registers do not
     automatically normalize, if you can store any bit pattern in one
     and retrieve it unchanged without a trap, then any machine mode
     may go in a floating register, so you can define this macro to say
     so.

     The primary significance of special floating registers is rather
     that they are the registers acceptable in floating point arithmetic
     instructions.  However, this is of no concern to
     `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'.  You handle it by writing the proper
     constraints for those instructions.

     On some machines, the floating registers are especially slow to
     access, so that it is better to store a value in a stack frame
     than in such a register if floating point arithmetic is not being
     done.  As long as the floating registers are not in class
     `GENERAL_REGS', they will not be used unless some pattern's
     constraint asks for one.

`MODES_TIEABLE_P (MODE1, MODE2)'
     A C expression that is nonzero if a value of mode MODE1 is
     accessible in mode MODE2 without copying.

     If `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (R, MODE1)' and `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK (R,
     MODE2)' are always the same for any R, then `MODES_TIEABLE_P
     (MODE1, MODE2)' should be nonzero.  If they differ for any R, you
     should define this macro to return zero unless some other
     mechanism ensures the accessibility of the value in a narrower
     mode.

     You should define this macro to return nonzero in as many cases as
     possible since doing so will allow GNU CC to perform better
     register allocation.

`AVOID_CCMODE_COPIES'
     Define this macro if the compiler should avoid copies to/from
     `CCmode' registers.  You should only define this macro if support
     fo copying to/from `CCmode' is incomplete.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Leaf Functions,  Next: Stack Registers,  Prev: Values in Registers,  Up: Registers

17.5.4 Handling Leaf Functions
------------------------------

On some machines, a leaf function (i.e., one which makes no calls) can
run more efficiently if it does not make its own register window.
Often this means it is required to receive its arguments in the
registers where they are passed by the caller, instead of the registers
where they would normally arrive.

   The special treatment for leaf functions generally applies only when
other conditions are met; for example, often they may use only those
registers for its own variables and temporaries.  We use the term "leaf
function" to mean a function that is suitable for this special
handling, so that functions with no calls are not necessarily "leaf
functions".

   GNU CC assigns register numbers before it knows whether the function
is suitable for leaf function treatment.  So it needs to renumber the
registers in order to output a leaf function.  The following macros
accomplish this.

`LEAF_REGISTERS'
     A C initializer for a vector, indexed by hard register number,
     which contains 1 for a register that is allowable in a candidate
     for leaf function treatment.

     If leaf function treatment involves renumbering the registers,
     then the registers marked here should be the ones before
     renumbering--those that GNU CC would ordinarily allocate.  The
     registers which will actually be used in the assembler code, after
     renumbering, should not be marked with 1 in this vector.

     Define this macro only if the target machine offers a way to
     optimize the treatment of leaf functions.

`LEAF_REG_REMAP (REGNO)'
     A C expression whose value is the register number to which REGNO
     should be renumbered, when a function is treated as a leaf
     function.

     If REGNO is a register number which should not appear in a leaf
     function before renumbering, then the expression should yield -1,
     which will cause the compiler to abort.

     Define this macro only if the target machine offers a way to
     optimize the treatment of leaf functions, and registers need to be
     renumbered to do this.

   Normally, `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must treat
leaf functions specially.  They can test the C variable
`current_function_is_leaf' which is nonzero for leaf functions.
`current_function_is_leaf' is set prior to local register allocation
and is valid for the remaining compiler passes.  They can also test the
C variable `current_function_uses_only_leaf_regs' which is nonzero for
leaf functions which only use leaf registers.
`current_function_uses_only_leaf_regs' is valid after reload and is
only useful if `LEAF_REGISTERS' is defined.

17.5.5 Registers That Form a Stack
----------------------------------

There are special features to handle computers where some of the
"registers" form a stack, as in the 80387 coprocessor for the 80386.
Stack registers are normally written by pushing onto the stack, and are
numbered relative to the top of the stack.

   Currently, GNU CC can only handle one group of stack-like registers,
and they must be consecutively numbered.

`STACK_REGS'
     Define this if the machine has any stack-like registers.

`FIRST_STACK_REG'
     The number of the first stack-like register.  This one is the top
     of the stack.

`LAST_STACK_REG'
     The number of the last stack-like register.  This one is the
     bottom of the stack.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Obsolete Register Macros,  Prev: Stack Registers,  Up: Registers

17.5.6 Obsolete Macros for Controlling Register Usage
-----------------------------------------------------

These features do not work very well.  They exist because they used to
be required to generate correct code for the 80387 coprocessor of the
80386.  They are no longer used by that machine description and may be
removed in a later version of the compiler.  Don't use them!

`OVERLAPPING_REGNO_P (REGNO)'
     If defined, this is a C expression whose value is nonzero if hard
     register number REGNO is an overlapping register.  This means a
     hard register which overlaps a hard register with a different
     number.  (Such overlap is undesirable, but occasionally it allows
     a machine to be supported which otherwise could not be.)  This
     macro must return nonzero for _all_ the registers which overlap
     each other.  GNU CC can use an overlapping register only in
     certain limited ways.  It can be used for allocation within a
     basic block, and may be spilled for reloading; that is all.

     If this macro is not defined, it means that none of the hard
     registers overlap each other.  This is the usual situation.

`INSN_CLOBBERS_REGNO_P (INSN, REGNO)'
     If defined, this is a C expression whose value should be nonzero if
     the insn INSN has the effect of mysteriously clobbering the
     contents of hard register number REGNO.  By "mysterious" we mean
     that the insn's RTL expression doesn't describe such an effect.

     If this macro is not defined, it means that no insn clobbers
     registers mysteriously.  This is the usual situation; all else
     being equal, it is best for the RTL expression to show all the
     activity.

17.6 Register Classes
=====================

On many machines, the numbered registers are not all equivalent.  For
example, certain registers may not be allowed for indexed addressing;
certain registers may not be allowed in some instructions.  These
machine restrictions are described to the compiler using "register
classes".

   You define a number of register classes, giving each one a name and
saying which of the registers belong to it.  Then you can specify
register classes that are allowed as operands to particular instruction
patterns.

   In general, each register will belong to several classes.  In fact,
one class must be named `ALL_REGS' and contain all the registers.
Another class must be named `NO_REGS' and contain no registers.  Often
the union of two classes will be another class; however, this is not
required.

   One of the classes must be named `GENERAL_REGS'.  There is nothing
terribly special about the name, but the operand constraint letters `r'
and `g' specify this class.  If `GENERAL_REGS' is the same as
`ALL_REGS', just define it as a macro which expands to `ALL_REGS'.

   Order the classes so that if class X is contained in class Y then X
has a lower class number than Y.

   The way classes other than `GENERAL_REGS' are specified in operand
constraints is through machine-dependent operand constraint letters.
You can define such letters to correspond to various classes, then use
them in operand constraints.

   You should define a class for the union of two classes whenever some
instruction allows both classes.  For example, if an instruction allows
either a floating point (coprocessor) register or a general register
for a certain operand, you should define a class `FLOAT_OR_GENERAL_REGS'
which includes both of them.  Otherwise you will get suboptimal code.

   You must also specify certain redundant information about the
register classes: for each class, which classes contain it and which
ones are contained in it; for each pair of classes, the largest class
contained in their union.

   When a value occupying several consecutive registers is expected in a
certain class, all the registers used must belong to that class.
Therefore, register classes cannot be used to enforce a requirement for
a register pair to start with an even-numbered register.  The way to
specify this requirement is with `HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK'.

   Register classes used for input-operands of bitwise-and or shift
instructions have a special requirement: each such class must have, for
each fixed-point machine mode, a subclass whose registers can transfer
that mode to or from memory.  For example, on some machines, the
operations for single-byte values (`QImode') are limited to certain
registers.  When this is so, each register class that is used in a
bitwise-and or shift instruction must have a subclass consisting of
registers from which single-byte values can be loaded or stored.  This
is so that `PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS' can always have a possible value to
return.

`enum reg_class'
     An enumeral type that must be defined with all the register class
     names as enumeral values.  `NO_REGS' must be first.  `ALL_REGS'
     must be the last register class, followed by one more enumeral
     value, `LIM_REG_CLASSES', which is not a register class but rather
     tells how many classes there are.

     Each register class has a number, which is the value of casting
     the class name to type `int'.  The number serves as an index in
     many of the tables described below.

`N_REG_CLASSES'
     The number of distinct register classes, defined as follows:

          #define N_REG_CLASSES (int) LIM_REG_CLASSES

`REG_CLASS_NAMES'
     An initializer containing the names of the register classes as C
     string constants.  These names are used in writing some of the
     debugging dumps.

`REG_CLASS_CONTENTS'
     An initializer containing the contents of the register classes, as
     integers which are bit masks.  The Nth integer specifies the
     contents of class N.  The way the integer MASK is interpreted is
     that register R is in the class if `MASK & (1 << R)' is 1.

     When the machine has more than 32 registers, an integer does not
     suffice.  Then the integers are replaced by sub-initializers,
     braced groupings containing several integers.  Each
     sub-initializer must be suitable as an initializer for the type
     `HARD_REG_SET' which is defined in `hard-reg-set.h'.

`REGNO_REG_CLASS (REGNO)'
     A C expression whose value is a register class containing hard
     register REGNO.  In general there is more than one such class;
     choose a class which is "minimal", meaning that no smaller class
     also contains the register.

`BASE_REG_CLASS'
     A macro whose definition is the name of the class to which a valid
     base register must belong.  A base register is one used in an
     address which is the register value plus a displacement.

`INDEX_REG_CLASS'
     A macro whose definition is the name of the class to which a valid
     index register must belong.  An index register is one used in an
     address where its value is either multiplied by a scale factor or
     added to another register (as well as added to a displacement).

`REG_CLASS_FROM_LETTER (CHAR)'
     A C expression which defines the machine-dependent operand
     constraint letters for register classes.  If CHAR is such a
     letter, the value should be the register class corresponding to
     it.  Otherwise, the value should be `NO_REGS'.  The register
     letter `r', corresponding to class `GENERAL_REGS', will not be
     passed to this macro; you do not need to handle it.

`REGNO_OK_FOR_BASE_P (NUM)'
     A C expression which is nonzero if register number NUM is suitable
     for use as a base register in operand addresses.  It may be either
     a suitable hard register or a pseudo register that has been
     allocated such a hard register.

`REGNO_MODE_OK_FOR_BASE_P (NUM, MODE)'
     A C expression that is just like `REGNO_OK_FOR_BASE_P', except that
     that expression may examine the mode of the memory reference in
     MODE.  You should define this macro if the mode of the memory
     reference affects whether a register may be used as a base
     register.  If you define this macro, the compiler will use it
     instead of `REGNO_OK_FOR_BASE_P'.

`REGNO_OK_FOR_INDEX_P (NUM)'
     A C expression which is nonzero if register number NUM is suitable
     for use as an index register in operand addresses.  It may be
     either a suitable hard register or a pseudo register that has been
     allocated such a hard register.

     The difference between an index register and a base register is
     that the index register may be scaled.  If an address involves the
     sum of two registers, neither one of them scaled, then either one
     may be labeled the "base" and the other the "index"; but whichever
     labeling is used must fit the machine's constraints of which
     registers may serve in each capacity.  The compiler will try both
     labelings, looking for one that is valid, and will reload one or
     both registers only if neither labeling works.

`PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS (X, CLASS)'
     A C expression that places additional restrictions on the register
     class to use when it is necessary to copy value X into a register
     in class CLASS.  The value is a register class; perhaps CLASS, or
     perhaps another, smaller class.  On many machines, the following
     definition is safe:

          #define PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS(X,CLASS) CLASS

     Sometimes returning a more restrictive class makes better code.
     For example, on the 68000, when X is an integer constant that is
     in range for a `moveq' instruction, the value of this macro is
     always `DATA_REGS' as long as CLASS includes the data registers.
     Requiring a data register guarantees that a `moveq' will be used.

     If X is a `const_double', by returning `NO_REGS' you can force X
     into a memory constant.  This is useful on certain machines where
     immediate floating values cannot be loaded into certain kinds of
     registers.

`PREFERRED_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (X, CLASS)'
     Like `PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS', but for output reloads instead of
     input reloads.  If you don't define this macro, the default is to
     use CLASS, unchanged.

`LIMIT_RELOAD_CLASS (MODE, CLASS)'
     A C expression that places additional restrictions on the register
     class to use when it is necessary to be able to hold a value of
     mode MODE in a reload register for which class CLASS would
     ordinarily be used.

     Unlike `PREFERRED_RELOAD_CLASS', this macro should be used when
     there are certain modes that simply can't go in certain reload
     classes.

     The value is a register class; perhaps CLASS, or perhaps another,
     smaller class.

     Don't define this macro unless the target machine has limitations
     which require the macro to do something nontrivial.

`SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS (CLASS, MODE, X)'
`SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (CLASS, MODE, X)'
`SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS (CLASS, MODE, X)'
     Many machines have some registers that cannot be copied directly
     to or from memory or even from other types of registers.  An
     example is the `MQ' register, which on most machines, can only be
     copied to or from general registers, but not memory.  Some
     machines allow copying all registers to and from memory, but
     require a scratch register for stores to some memory locations
     (e.g., those with symbolic address on the RT, and those with
     certain symbolic address on the Sparc when compiling PIC).  In
     some cases, both an intermediate and a scratch register are
     required.

     You should define these macros to indicate to the reload phase
     that it may need to allocate at least one register for a reload in
     addition to the register to contain the data.  Specifically, if
     copying X to a register CLASS in MODE requires an intermediate
     register, you should define `SECONDARY_INPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' to
     return the largest register class all of whose registers can be
     used as intermediate registers or scratch registers.

     If copying a register CLASS in MODE to X requires an intermediate
     or scratch register, `SECONDARY_OUTPUT_RELOAD_CLASS' should be
     defined to return the largest register class required.  If the
     requirements for input and output reloads are the same, the macro
     `SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS' should be used instead of defining both
     macros identically.

     The values returned by these macros are often `GENERAL_REGS'.
     Return `NO_REGS' if no spare register is needed; i.e., if X can be
     directly copied to or from a register of CLASS in MODE without
     requiring a scratch register.  Do not define this macro if it
     would always return `NO_REGS'.

     If a scratch register is required (either with or without an
     intermediate register), you should define patterns for
     `reload_inM' or `reload_outM', as required (*note Standard
     Names::.  These patterns, which will normally be implemented with
     a `define_expand', should be similar to the `movM' patterns,
     except that operand 2 is the scratch register.

     Define constraints for the reload register and scratch register
     that contain a single register class.  If the original reload
     register (whose class is CLASS) can meet the constraint given in
     the pattern, the value returned by these macros is used for the
     class of the scratch register.  Otherwise, two additional reload
     registers are required.  Their classes are obtained from the
     constraints in the insn pattern.

     X might be a pseudo-register or a `subreg' of a pseudo-register,
     which could either be in a hard register or in memory.  Use
     `true_regnum' to find out; it will return -1 if the pseudo is in
     memory and the hard register number if it is in a register.

     These macros should not be used in the case where a particular
     class of registers can only be copied to memory and not to another
     class of registers.  In that case, secondary reload registers are
     not needed and would not be helpful.  Instead, a stack location
     must be used to perform the copy and the `movM' pattern should use
     memory as a intermediate storage.  This case often occurs between
     floating-point and general registers.

`SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED (CLASS1, CLASS2, M)'
     Certain machines have the property that some registers cannot be
     copied to some other registers without using memory.  Define this
     macro on those machines to be a C expression that is non-zero if
     objects of mode M in registers of CLASS1 can only be copied to
     registers of class CLASS2 by storing a register of CLASS1 into
     memory and loading that memory location into a register of CLASS2.

     Do not define this macro if its value would always be zero.

`SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED_RTX (MODE)'
     Normally when `SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED' is defined, the compiler
     allocates a stack slot for a memory location needed for register
     copies.  If this macro is defined, the compiler instead uses the
     memory location defined by this macro.

     Do not define this macro if you do not define
     `SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED'.

`SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED_MODE (MODE)'
     When the compiler needs a secondary memory location to copy
     between two registers of mode MODE, it normally allocates
     sufficient memory to hold a quantity of `BITS_PER_WORD' bits and
     performs the store and load operations in a mode that many bits
     wide and whose class is the same as that of MODE.

     This is right thing to do on most machines because it ensures that
     all bits of the register are copied and prevents accesses to the
     registers in a narrower mode, which some machines prohibit for
     floating-point registers.

     However, this default behavior is not correct on some machines,
     such as the DEC Alpha, that store short integers in floating-point
     registers differently than in integer registers.  On those
     machines, the default widening will not work correctly and you
     must define this macro to suppress that widening in some cases.
     See the file `alpha.h' for details.

     Do not define this macro if you do not define
     `SECONDARY_MEMORY_NEEDED' or if widening MODE to a mode that is
     `BITS_PER_WORD' bits wide is correct for your machine.

`SMALL_REGISTER_CLASSES'
     On some machines, it is risky to let hard registers live across
     arbitrary insns.  Typically, these machines have instructions that
     require values to be in specific registers (like an accumulator),
     and reload will fail if the required hard register is used for
     another purpose across such an insn.

     Define `SMALL_REGISTER_CLASSES' to be an expression with a non-zero
     value on these machines.  When this macro has a non-zero value, the
     compiler will try to minimize the lifetime of hard registers.

     It is always safe to define this macro with a non-zero value, but
     if you unnecessarily define it, you will reduce the amount of
     optimizations that can be performed in some cases.  If you do not
     define this macro with a non-zero value when it is required, the
     compiler will run out of spill registers and print a fatal error
     message.  For most machines, you should not define this macro at
     all.

`CLASS_LIKELY_SPILLED_P (CLASS)'
     A C expression whose value is nonzero if pseudos that have been
     assigned to registers of class CLASS would likely be spilled
     because registers of CLASS are needed for spill registers.

     The default value of this macro returns 1 if CLASS has exactly one
     register and zero otherwise.  On most machines, this default
     should be used.  Only define this macro to some other expression
     if pseudos allocated by `local-alloc.c' end up in memory because
     their hard registers were needed for spill registers.  If this
     macro returns nonzero for those classes, those pseudos will only
     be allocated by `global.c', which knows how to reallocate the
     pseudo to another register.  If there would not be another
     register available for reallocation, you should not change the
     definition of this macro since the only effect of such a
     definition would be to slow down register allocation.

`CLASS_MAX_NREGS (CLASS, MODE)'
     A C expression for the maximum number of consecutive registers of
     class CLASS needed to hold a value of mode MODE.

     This is closely related to the macro `HARD_REGNO_NREGS'.  In fact,
     the value of the macro `CLASS_MAX_NREGS (CLASS, MODE)' should be
     the maximum value of `HARD_REGNO_NREGS (REGNO, MODE)' for all
     REGNO values in the class CLASS.

     This macro helps control the handling of multiple-word values in
     the reload pass.

`CLASS_CANNOT_CHANGE_SIZE'
     If defined, a C expression for a class that contains registers
     which the compiler must always access in a mode that is the same
     size as the mode in which it loaded the register.

     For the example, loading 32-bit integer or floating-point objects
     into floating-point registers on the Alpha extends them to 64-bits.
     Therefore loading a 64-bit object and then storing it as a 32-bit
     object does not store the low-order 32-bits, as would be the case
     for a normal register.  Therefore, `alpha.h' defines this macro as
     `FLOAT_REGS'.

   Three other special macros describe which operands fit which
constraint letters.

`CONST_OK_FOR_LETTER_P (VALUE, C)'
     A C expression that defines the machine-dependent operand
     constraint letters (`I', `J', `K', ... `P') that specify
     particular ranges of integer values.  If C is one of those
     letters, the expression should check that VALUE, an integer, is in
     the appropriate range and return 1 if so, 0 otherwise.  If C is
     not one of those letters, the value should be 0 regardless of
     VALUE.

`CONST_DOUBLE_OK_FOR_LETTER_P (VALUE, C)'
     A C expression that defines the machine-dependent operand
     constraint letters that specify particular ranges of
     `const_double' values (`G' or `H').

     If C is one of those letters, the expression should check that
     VALUE, an RTX of code `const_double', is in the appropriate range
     and return 1 if so, 0 otherwise.  If C is not one of those
     letters, the value should be 0 regardless of VALUE.

     `const_double' is used for all floating-point constants and for
     `DImode' fixed-point constants.  A given letter can accept either
     or both kinds of values.  It can use `GET_MODE' to distinguish
     between these kinds.

`EXTRA_CONSTRAINT (VALUE, C)'
     A C expression that defines the optional machine-dependent
     constraint letters (`Q', `R', `S', `T', `U') that can be used to
     segregate specific types of operands, usually memory references,
     for the target machine.  Normally this macro will not be defined.
     If it is required for a particular target machine, it should
     return 1 if VALUE corresponds to the operand type represented by
     the constraint letter C.  If C is not defined as an extra
     constraint, the value returned should be 0 regardless of VALUE.

     For example, on the ROMP, load instructions cannot have their
     output in r0 if the memory reference contains a symbolic address.
     Constraint letter `Q' is defined as representing a memory address
     that does _not_ contain a symbolic address.  An alternative is
     specified with a `Q' constraint on the input and `r' on the
     output.  The next alternative specifies `m' on the input and a
     register class that does not include r0 on the output.

File: gcc.info,  Node: Frame Layout,  Next: Stack Checking,  Up: Stack and Calling

17.7.1 Basic Stack Layout
-------------------------

Here is the basic stack layout.

`STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD'
     Define this macro if pushing a word onto the stack moves the stack
     pointer to a smaller address.

     When we say, "define this macro if ...," it means that the
     compiler checks this macro only with `#ifdef' so the precise
     definition used does not matter.

`FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARD'
     Define this macro if the addresses of local variable slots are at
     negative offsets from the frame pointer.

`ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD'
     Define this macro if successive arguments to a function occupy
     decreasing addresses on the stack.

`STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET'
     Offset from the frame pointer to the first local variable slot to
     be allocated.

     If `FRAME_GROWS_DOWNWARD', find the next slot's offset by
     subtracting the first slot's length from `STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET'.
     Otherwise, it is found by adding the length of the first slot to
     the value `STARTING_FRAME_OFFSET'.

`STACK_POINTER_OFFSET'
     Offset from the stack pointer register to the first location at
     which outgoing arguments are placed.  If not specified, the
     default value of zero is used.  This is the proper value for most
     machines.

     If `ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD', this is the offset to the location above
     the first location at which outgoing arguments are placed.

`FIRST_PARM_OFFSET (FUNDECL)'
     Offset from the argument pointer register to the first argument's
     address.  On some machines it may depend on the data type of the
     function.

     If `ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD', this is the offset to the location above
     the first argument's address.

`STACK_DYNAMIC_OFFSET (FUNDECL)'
     Offset from the stack pointer register to an item dynamically
     allocated on the stack, e.g., by `alloca'.

     The default value for this macro is `STACK_POINTER_OFFSET' plus the
     length of the outgoing arguments.  The default is correct for most
     machines.  See `function.c' for details.

`DYNAMIC_CHAIN_ADDRESS (FRAMEADDR)'
     A C expression whose value is RTL representing the address in a
     stack frame where the pointer to the caller's frame is stored.
     Assume that FRAMEADDR is an RTL expression for the address of the
     stack frame itself.

     If you don't define this macro, the default is to return the value
     of FRAMEADDR--that is, the stack frame address is also the address
     of the stack word that points to the previous frame.

`SETUP_FRAME_ADDRESSES'
     If defined, a C expression that produces the machine-specific code
     to setup the stack so that arbitrary frames can be accessed.  For
     example, on the Sparc, we must flush all of the register windows
     to the stack before we can access arbitrary stack frames.  You
     will seldom need to define this macro.

`BUILTIN_SETJMP_FRAME_VALUE'
     If defined, a C expression that contains an rtx that is used to
     store the address of the current frame into the built in `setjmp'
     buffer.  The default value, `virtual_stack_vars_rtx', is correct
     for most machines.  One reason you may need to define this macro
     is if `hard_frame_pointer_rtx' is the appropriate value on your
     machine.

`RETURN_ADDR_RTX (COUNT, FRAMEADDR)'
     A C expression whose value is RTL representing the value of the
     return address for the frame COUNT steps up from the current
     frame, after the prologue.  FRAMEADDR is the frame pointer of the
     COUNT frame, or the frame pointer of the COUNT - 1 frame if
     `RETURN_ADDR_IN_PREVIOUS_FRAME' is defined.

     The value of the expression must always be the correct address when
     COUNT is zero, but may be `NULL_RTX' if there is not way to
     determine the return address of other frames.

`RETURN_ADDR_IN_PREVIOUS_FRAME'
     Define this if the return address of a particular stack frame is
     accessed from the frame pointer of the previous stack frame.

`INCOMING_RETURN_ADDR_RTX'
     A C expression whose value is RTL representing the location of the
     incoming return address at the beginning of any function, before
     the prologue.  This RTL is either a `REG', indicating that the
     return value is saved in `REG', or a `MEM' representing a location
     in the stack.

     You only need to define this macro if you want to support call
     frame debugging information like that provided by DWARF 2.

`INCOMING_FRAME_SP_OFFSET'
     A C expression whose value is an integer giving the offset, in
     bytes, from the value of the stack pointer register to the top of
     the stack frame at the beginning of any function, before the
     prologue.  The top of the frame is defined to be the value of the
     stack pointer in the previous frame, just before the call
     instruction.

     You only need to define this macro if you want to support call
     frame debugging information like that provided by DWARF 2.

`ARG_POINTER_CFA_OFFSET'
     A C expression whose value is an integer giving the offset, in
     bytes, from the argument pointer to the canonical frame address
     (cfa).  The final value should coincide with that calculated by
     `INCOMING_FRAME_SP_OFFSET'.  Which is unfortunately not usable
     during virtual register instantiation.

     You only need to define this macro if you want to support call
     frame debugging information like that provided by DWARF 2.

17.7.2 Specifying How Stack Checking is Done
--------------------------------------------

GNU CC will check that stack references are within the boundaries of
the stack, if the `-fstack-check' is specified, in one of three ways:

  1. If the value of the `STACK_CHECK_BUILTIN' macro is nonzero, GNU CC
     will assume that you have arranged for stack checking to be done at
     appropriate places in the configuration files, e.g., in
     `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE'.  GNU CC will do not other special processing.

  2. If `STACK_CHECK_BUILTIN' is zero and you defined a named pattern
     called `check_stack' in your `md' file, GNU CC will call that
     pattern with one argument which is the address to compare the stack
     value against.  You must arrange for this pattern to report an
     error if the stack pointer is out of range.

  3. If neither of the above are true, GNU CC will generate code to
     periodically "probe" the stack pointer using the values of the
     macros defined below.

   Normally, you will use the default values of these macros, so GNU CC
will use the third approach.

`STACK_CHECK_BUILTIN'
     A nonzero value if stack checking is done by the configuration
     files in a machine-dependent manner.  You should define this macro
     if stack checking is require by the ABI of your machine or if you
     would like to have to stack checking in some more efficient way
     than GNU CC's portable approach.  The default value of this macro
     is zero.

`STACK_CHECK_PROBE_INTERVAL'
     An integer representing the interval at which GNU CC must generate
     stack probe instructions.  You will normally define this macro to
     be no larger than the size of the "guard pages" at the end of a
     stack area.  The default value of 4096 is suitable for most
     systems.

`STACK_CHECK_PROBE_LOAD'
     A integer which is nonzero if GNU CC should perform the stack probe
     as a load instruction and zero if GNU CC should use a store
     instruction.  The default is zero, which is the most efficient
     choice on most systems.

`STACK_CHECK_PROTECT'
     The number of bytes of stack needed to recover from a stack
     overflow, for languages where such a recovery is supported.  The
     default value of 75 words should be adequate for most machines.

`STACK_CHECK_MAX_FRAME_SIZE'
     The maximum size of a stack frame, in bytes.  GNU CC will generate
     probe instructions in non-leaf functions to ensure at least this
     many bytes of stack are available.  If a stack frame is larger
     than this size, stack checking will not be reliable and GNU CC
     will issue a warning.  The default is chosen so that GNU CC only
     generates one instruction on most systems.  You should normally
     not change the default value of this macro.

`STACK_CHECK_FIXED_FRAME_SIZE'
     GNU CC uses this value to generate the above warning message.  It
     represents the amount of fixed frame used by a function, not
     including space for any callee-saved registers, temporaries and
     user variables.  You need only specify an upper bound for this
     amount and will normally use the default of four words.

`STACK_CHECK_MAX_VAR_SIZE'
     The maximum size, in bytes, of an object that GNU CC will place in
     the fixed area of the stack frame when the user specifies
     `-fstack-check'.  GNU CC computed the default from the values of
     the above macros and you will normally not need to override that
     default.

17.7.3 Registers That Address the Stack Frame
---------------------------------------------

This discusses registers that address the stack frame.

`STACK_POINTER_REGNUM'
     The register number of the stack pointer register, which must also
     be a fixed register according to `FIXED_REGISTERS'.  On most
     machines, the hardware determines which register this is.

`FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM'
     The register number of the frame pointer register, which is used to
     access automatic variables in the stack frame.  On some machines,
     the hardware determines which register this is.  On other
     machines, you can choose any register you wish for this purpose.

`HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM'
     On some machines the offset between the frame pointer and starting
     offset of the automatic variables is not known until after register
     allocation has been done (for example, because the saved registers
     are between these two locations).  On those machines, define
     `FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' the number of a special, fixed register to
     be used internally until the offset is known, and define
     `HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' to be the actual hard register number
     used for the frame pointer.

     You should define this macro only in the very rare circumstances
     when it is not possible to calculate the offset between the frame
     pointer and the automatic variables until after register
     allocation has been completed.  When this macro is defined, you
     must also indicate in your definition of `ELIMINABLE_REGS' how to
     eliminate `FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' into either
     `HARD_FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM' or `STACK_POINTER_REGNUM'.

     Do not define this macro if it would be the same as
     `FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM'.

`ARG_POINTER_REGNUM'
     The register number of the arg pointer register, which is used to
     access the function's argument list.  On some machines, this is
     the same as the frame pointer register.  On some machines, the
     hardware determines which register this is.  On other machines,
     you can choose any register you wish for this purpose.  If this is
     not the same register as the frame pointer register, then you must
     mark it as a fixed register according to `FIXED_REGISTERS', or
     arrange to be able to eliminate it (*note Elimination::).

`RETURN_ADDRESS_POINTER_REGNUM'
     The register number of the return address pointer register, which
     is used to access the current function's return address from the
     stack.  On some machines, the return address is not at a fixed
     offset from the frame pointer or stack pointer or argument
     pointer.  This register can be defined to point to the return
     address on the stack, and then be converted by `ELIMINABLE_REGS'
     into either the frame pointer or stack pointer.

     Do not define this macro unless there is no other way to get the
     return address from the stack.

`STATIC_CHAIN_REGNUM'
`STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM'
     Register numbers used for passing a function's static chain
     pointer.  If register windows are used, the register number as
     seen by the called function is `STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM',
     while the register number as seen by the calling function is
     `STATIC_CHAIN_REGNUM'.  If these registers are the same,
     `STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING_REGNUM' need not be defined.

     The static chain register need not be a fixed register.

     If the static chain is passed in memory, these macros should not be
     defined; instead, the next two macros should be defined.

`STATIC_CHAIN'
`STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING'
     If the static chain is passed in memory, these macros provide rtx
     giving `mem' expressions that denote where they are stored.
     `STATIC_CHAIN' and `STATIC_CHAIN_INCOMING' give the locations as
     seen by the calling and called functions, respectively.  Often the
     former will be at an offset from the stack pointer and the latter
     at an offset from the frame pointer.

     The variables `stack_pointer_rtx', `frame_pointer_rtx', and
     `arg_pointer_rtx' will have been initialized prior to the use of
     these macros and should be used to refer to those items.

     If the static chain is passed in a register, the two previous
     macros should be defined instead.

17.7.4 Eliminating Frame Pointer and Arg Pointer
------------------------------------------------

This is about eliminating the frame pointer and arg pointer.

`FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED'
     A C expression which is nonzero if a function must have and use a
     frame pointer.  This expression is evaluated  in the reload pass.
     If its value is nonzero the function will have a frame pointer.

     The expression can in principle examine the current function and
     decide according to the facts, but on most machines the constant 0
     or the constant 1 suffices.  Use 0 when the machine allows code to
     be generated with no frame pointer, and doing so saves some time
     or space.  Use 1 when there is no possible advantage to avoiding a
     frame pointer.

     In certain cases, the compiler does not know how to produce valid
     code without a frame pointer.  The compiler recognizes those cases
     and automatically gives the function a frame pointer regardless of
     what `FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED' says.  You don't need to worry about
     them.

     In a function that does not require a frame pointer, the frame
     pointer register can be allocated for ordinary usage, unless you
     mark it as a fixed register.  See `FIXED_REGISTERS' for more
     information.

`INITIAL_FRAME_POINTER_OFFSET (DEPTH-VAR)'
     A C statement to store in the variable DEPTH-VAR the difference
     between the frame pointer and the stack pointer values immediately
     after the function prologue.  The value would be computed from
     information such as the result of `get_frame_size ()' and the
     tables of registers `regs_ever_live' and `call_used_regs'.

     If `ELIMINABLE_REGS' is defined, this macro will be not be used and
     need not be defined.  Otherwise, it must be defined even if
     `FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED' is defined to always be true; in that
     case, you may set DEPTH-VAR to anything.

`ELIMINABLE_REGS'
     If defined, this macro specifies a table of register pairs used to
     eliminate unneeded registers that point into the stack frame.  If
     it is not defined, the only elimination attempted by the compiler
     is to replace references to the frame pointer with references to
     the stack pointer.

     The definition of this macro is a list of structure
     initializations, each of which specifies an original and
     replacement register.

     On some machines, the position of the argument pointer is not
     known until the compilation is completed.  In such a case, a
     separate hard register must be used for the argument pointer.
     This register can be eliminated by replacing it with either the
     frame pointer or the argument pointer, depending on whether or not
     the frame pointer has been eliminated.

     In this case, you might specify:
          #define ELIMINABLE_REGS  \
          {{ARG_POINTER_REGNUM, STACK_POINTER_REGNUM}, \
           {ARG_POINTER_REGNUM, FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM}, \
           {FRAME_POINTER_REGNUM, STACK_POINTER_REGNUM}}

     Note that the elimination of the argument pointer with the stack
     pointer is specified first since that is the preferred elimination.

`CAN_ELIMINATE (FROM-REG, TO-REG)'
     A C expression that returns non-zero if the compiler is allowed to
     try to replace register number FROM-REG with register number
     TO-REG.  This macro need only be defined if `ELIMINABLE_REGS' is
     defined, and will usually be the constant 1, since most of the
     cases preventing register elimination are things that the compiler
     already knows about.

`INITIAL_ELIMINATION_OFFSET (FROM-REG, TO-REG, OFFSET-VAR)'
     This macro is similar to `INITIAL_FRAME_POINTER_OFFSET'.  It
     specifies the initial difference between the specified pair of
     registers.  This macro must be defined if `ELIMINABLE_REGS' is
     defined.

`LONGJMP_RESTORE_FROM_STACK'
     Define this macro if the `longjmp' function restores registers from
     the stack frames, rather than from those saved specifically by
     `setjmp'.  Certain quantities must not be kept in registers across
     a call to `setjmp' on such machines.

17.7.5 Passing Function Arguments on the Stack
----------------------------------------------

The macros in this section control how arguments are passed on the
stack.  See the following section for other macros that control passing
certain arguments in registers.

`PROMOTE_PROTOTYPES'
     Define this macro if an argument declared in a prototype as an
     integral type smaller than `int' should actually be passed as an
     `int'.  In addition to avoiding errors in certain cases of
     mismatch, it also makes for better code on certain machines.

`PUSH_ROUNDING (NPUSHED)'
     A C expression that is the number of bytes actually pushed onto the
     stack when an instruction attempts to push NPUSHED bytes.

     If the target machine does not have a push instruction, do not
     define this macro.  That directs GNU CC to use an alternate
     strategy: to allocate the entire argument block and then store the
     arguments into it.

     On some machines, the definition

          #define PUSH_ROUNDING(BYTES) (BYTES)

     will suffice.  But on other machines, instructions that appear to
     push one byte actually push two bytes in an attempt to maintain
     alignment.  Then the definition should be

          #define PUSH_ROUNDING(BYTES) (((BYTES) + 1) & ~1)

`ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS'
     If defined, the maximum amount of space required for outgoing
     arguments will be computed and placed into the variable
     `current_function_outgoing_args_size'.  No space will be pushed
     onto the stack for each call; instead, the function prologue should
     increase the stack frame size by this amount.

     Defining both `PUSH_ROUNDING' and `ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS' is
     not proper.

`REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE (FNDECL)'
     Define this macro if functions should assume that stack space has
     been allocated for arguments even when their values are passed in
     registers.

     The value of this macro is the size, in bytes, of the area
     reserved for arguments passed in registers for the function
     represented by FNDECL, which can be zero if GNU CC is calling a
     library function.

     This space can be allocated by the caller, or be a part of the
     machine-dependent stack frame: `OUTGOING_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' says
     which.

`MAYBE_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE'
`FINAL_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE (CONST_SIZE, VAR_SIZE)'
     Define these macros in addition to the one above if functions might
     allocate stack space for arguments even when their values are
     passed in registers.  These should be used when the stack space
     allocated for arguments in registers is not a simple constant
     independent of the function declaration.

     The value of the first macro is the size, in bytes, of the area
     that we should initially assume would be reserved for arguments
     passed in registers.

     The value of the second macro is the actual size, in bytes, of the
     area that will be reserved for arguments passed in registers.
     This takes two arguments: an integer representing the number of
     bytes of fixed sized arguments on the stack, and a tree
     representing the number of bytes of variable sized arguments on
     the stack.

     When these macros are defined, `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' will only be
     called for libcall functions, the current function, or for a
     function being called when it is known that such stack space must
     be allocated.  In each case this value can be easily computed.

     When deciding whether a called function needs such stack space,
     and how much space to reserve, GNU CC uses these two macros
     instead of `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE'.

`OUTGOING_REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE'
     Define this if it is the responsibility of the caller to allocate
     the area reserved for arguments passed in registers.

     If `ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS' is defined, this macro controls
     whether the space for these arguments counts in the value of
     `current_function_outgoing_args_size'.

`STACK_PARMS_IN_REG_PARM_AREA'
     Define this macro if `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' is defined, but the
     stack parameters don't skip the area specified by it.

     Normally, when a parameter is not passed in registers, it is
     placed on the stack beyond the `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' area.
     Defining this macro suppresses this behavior and causes the
     parameter to be passed on the stack in its natural location.

`RETURN_POPS_ARGS (FUNDECL, FUNTYPE, STACK-SIZE)'
     A C expression that should indicate the number of bytes of its own
     arguments that a function pops on returning, or 0 if the function
     pops no arguments and the caller must therefore pop them all after
     the function returns.

     FUNDECL is a C variable whose value is a tree node that describes
     the function in question.  Normally it is a node of type
     `FUNCTION_DECL' that describes the declaration of the function.
     From this you can obtain the DECL_MACHINE_ATTRIBUTES of the
     function.

     FUNTYPE is a C variable whose value is a tree node that describes
     the function in question.  Normally it is a node of type
     `FUNCTION_TYPE' that describes the data type of the function.
     From this it is possible to obtain the data types of the value and
     arguments (if known).

     When a call to a library function is being considered, FUNDECL
     will contain an identifier node for the library function.  Thus, if
     you need to distinguish among various library functions, you can
     do so by their names.  Note that "library function" in this
     context means a function used to perform arithmetic, whose name is
     known specially in the compiler and was not mentioned in the C
     code being compiled.

     STACK-SIZE is the number of bytes of arguments passed on the
     stack.  If a variable number of bytes is passed, it is zero, and
     argument popping will always be the responsibility of the calling
     function.

     On the Vax, all functions always pop their arguments, so the
     definition of this macro is STACK-SIZE.  On the 68000, using the
     standard calling convention, no functions pop their arguments, so
     the value of the macro is always 0 in this case.  But an
     alternative calling convention is available in which functions
     that take a fixed number of arguments pop them but other functions
     (such as `printf') pop nothing (the caller pops all).  When this
     convention is in use, FUNTYPE is examined to determine whether a
     function takes a fixed number of arguments.

17.7.6 Passing Arguments in Registers
-------------------------------------

This section describes the macros which let you control how various
types of arguments are passed in registers or how they are arranged in
the stack.

`FUNCTION_ARG (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)'
     A C expression that controls whether a function argument is passed
     in a register, and which register.

     The arguments are CUM, which summarizes all the previous
     arguments; MODE, the machine mode of the argument; TYPE, the data
     type of the argument as a tree node or 0 if that is not known
     (which happens for C support library functions); and NAMED, which
     is 1 for an ordinary argument and 0 for nameless arguments that
     correspond to `...' in the called function's prototype.

     The value of the expression is usually either a `reg' RTX for the
     hard register in which to pass the argument, or zero to pass the
     argument on the stack.

     For machines like the Vax and 68000, where normally all arguments
     are pushed, zero suffices as a definition.

     The value of the expression can also be a `parallel' RTX.  This is
     used when an argument is passed in multiple locations.  The mode
     of the of the `parallel' should be the mode of the entire
     argument.  The `parallel' holds any number of `expr_list' pairs;
     each one describes where part of the argument is passed.  In each
     `expr_list' the first operand must be a `reg' RTX for the hard
     register in which to pass this part of the argument, and the mode
     of the register RTX indicates how large this part of the argument
     is.  The second operand of the `expr_list' is a `const_int' which
     gives the offset in bytes into the entire argument of where this
     part starts.  As a special exception the first `expr_list' in the
     `parallel' RTX may have a first operand of zero.  This indicates
     that the bytes starting from the second operand of that
     `expr_list' are stored on the stack and not held in a register.

     The usual way to make the ANSI library `stdarg.h' work on a machine
     where some arguments are usually passed in registers, is to cause
     nameless arguments to be passed on the stack instead.  This is done
     by making `FUNCTION_ARG' return 0 whenever NAMED is 0.

     You may use the macro `MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (MODE, TYPE)' in the
     definition of this macro to determine if this argument is of a
     type that must be passed in the stack.  If `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE'
     is not defined and `FUNCTION_ARG' returns non-zero for such an
     argument, the compiler will abort.  If `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' is
     defined, the argument will be computed in the stack and then
     loaded into a register.

`MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (MODE, TYPE)'
     Define as a C expression that evaluates to nonzero if we do not
     know how to pass TYPE solely in registers.  The file `expr.h'
     defines a definition that is usually appropriate, refer to
     `expr.h' for additional documentation.

`FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)'
     Define this macro if the target machine has "register windows", so
     that the register in which a function sees an arguments is not
     necessarily the same as the one in which the caller passed the
     argument.

     For such machines, `FUNCTION_ARG' computes the register in which
     the caller passes the value, and `FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG' should be
     defined in a similar fashion to tell the function being called
     where the arguments will arrive.

     If `FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG' is not defined, `FUNCTION_ARG' serves
     both purposes.

`FUNCTION_ARG_PARTIAL_NREGS (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)'
     A C expression for the number of words, at the beginning of an
     argument, must be put in registers.  The value must be zero for
     arguments that are passed entirely in registers or that are
     entirely pushed on the stack.

     On some machines, certain arguments must be passed partially in
     registers and partially in memory.  On these machines, typically
     the first N words of arguments are passed in registers, and the
     rest on the stack.  If a multi-word argument (a `double' or a
     structure) crosses that boundary, its first few words must be
     passed in registers and the rest must be pushed.  This macro tells
     the compiler when this occurs, and how many of the words should go
     in registers.

     `FUNCTION_ARG' for these arguments should return the first
     register to be used by the caller for this argument; likewise
     `FUNCTION_INCOMING_ARG', for the called function.

`FUNCTION_ARG_PASS_BY_REFERENCE (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)'
     A C expression that indicates when an argument must be passed by
     reference.  If nonzero for an argument, a copy of that argument is
     made in memory and a pointer to the argument is passed instead of
     the argument itself.  The pointer is passed in whatever way is
     appropriate for passing a pointer to that type.

     On machines where `REG_PARM_STACK_SPACE' is not defined, a suitable
     definition of this macro might be
          #define FUNCTION_ARG_PASS_BY_REFERENCE\
          (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)  \
            MUST_PASS_IN_STACK (MODE, TYPE)

`FUNCTION_ARG_CALLEE_COPIES (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)'
     If defined, a C expression that indicates when it is the called
     function's responsibility to make a copy of arguments passed by
     invisible reference.  Normally, the caller makes a copy and passes
     the address of the copy to the routine being called.  When
     FUNCTION_ARG_CALLEE_COPIES is defined and is nonzero, the caller
     does not make a copy.  Instead, it passes a pointer to the "live"
     value.  The called function must not modify this value.  If it can
     be determined that the value won't be modified, it need not make a
     copy; otherwise a copy must be made.

`CUMULATIVE_ARGS'
     A C type for declaring a variable that is used as the first
     argument of `FUNCTION_ARG' and other related values.  For some
     target machines, the type `int' suffices and can hold the number
     of bytes of argument so far.

     There is no need to record in `CUMULATIVE_ARGS' anything about the
     arguments that have been passed on the stack.  The compiler has
     other variables to keep track of that.  For target machines on
     which all arguments are passed on the stack, there is no need to
     store anything in `CUMULATIVE_ARGS'; however, the data structure
     must exist and should not be empty, so use `int'.

`INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS (CUM, FNTYPE, LIBNAME, INDIRECT)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) for initializing the variable CUM
     for the state at the beginning of the argument list.  The variable
     has type `CUMULATIVE_ARGS'.  The value of FNTYPE is the tree node
     for the data type of the function which will receive the args, or 0
     if the args are to a compiler support library function.  The value
     of INDIRECT is nonzero when processing an indirect call, for
     example a call through a function pointer.  The value of INDIRECT
     is zero for a call to an explicitly named function, a library
     function call, or when `INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS' is used to find
     arguments for the function being compiled.

     When processing a call to a compiler support library function,
     LIBNAME identifies which one.  It is a `symbol_ref' rtx which
     contains the name of the function, as a string.  LIBNAME is 0 when
     an ordinary C function call is being processed.  Thus, each time
     this macro is called, either LIBNAME or FNTYPE is nonzero, but
     never both of them at once.

`INIT_CUMULATIVE_INCOMING_ARGS (CUM, FNTYPE, LIBNAME)'
     Like `INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS' but overrides it for the purposes of
     finding the arguments for the function being compiled.  If this
     macro is undefined, `INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS' is used instead.

     The value passed for LIBNAME is always 0, since library routines
     with special calling conventions are never compiled with GNU CC.
     The argument LIBNAME exists for symmetry with
     `INIT_CUMULATIVE_ARGS'.

`FUNCTION_ARG_ADVANCE (CUM, MODE, TYPE, NAMED)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to update the summarizer variable
     CUM to advance past an argument in the argument list.  The values
     MODE, TYPE and NAMED describe that argument.  Once this is done,
     the variable CUM is suitable for analyzing the _following_
     argument with `FUNCTION_ARG', etc.

     This macro need not do anything if the argument in question was
     passed on the stack.  The compiler knows how to track the amount
     of stack space used for arguments without any special help.

`FUNCTION_ARG_PADDING (MODE, TYPE)'
     If defined, a C expression which determines whether, and in which
     direction, to pad out an argument with extra space.  The value
     should be of type `enum direction': either `upward' to pad above
     the argument, `downward' to pad below, or `none' to inhibit
     padding.

     The _amount_ of padding is always just enough to reach the next
     multiple of `FUNCTION_ARG_BOUNDARY'; this macro does not control
     it.

     This macro has a default definition which is right for most
     systems.  For little-endian machines, the default is to pad
     upward.  For big-endian machines, the default is to pad downward
     for an argument of constant size shorter than an `int', and upward
     otherwise.

`FUNCTION_ARG_BOUNDARY (MODE, TYPE)'
     If defined, a C expression that gives the alignment boundary, in
     bits, of an argument with the specified mode and type.  If it is
     not defined, `PARM_BOUNDARY' is used for all arguments.

`FUNCTION_ARG_REGNO_P (REGNO)'
     A C expression that is nonzero if REGNO is the number of a hard
     register in which function arguments are sometimes passed.  This
     does _not_ include implicit arguments such as the static chain and
     the structure-value address.  On many machines, no registers can be
     used for this purpose since all function arguments are pushed on
     the stack.

`LOAD_ARGS_REVERSED'
     If defined, the order in which arguments are loaded into their
     respective argument registers is reversed so that the last
     argument is loaded first.  This macro only effects arguments
     passed in registers.

17.7.7 How Scalar Function Values Are Returned
----------------------------------------------

This section discusses the macros that control returning scalars as
values--values that can fit in registers.

`TRADITIONAL_RETURN_FLOAT'
     Define this macro if `-traditional' should not cause functions
     declared to return `float' to convert the value to `double'.

`FUNCTION_VALUE (VALTYPE, FUNC)'
     A C expression to create an RTX representing the place where a
     function returns a value of data type VALTYPE.  VALTYPE is a tree
     node representing a data type.  Write `TYPE_MODE (VALTYPE)' to get
     the machine mode used to represent that type.  On many machines,
     only the mode is relevant.  (Actually, on most machines, scalar
     values are returned in the same place regardless of mode).

     The value of the expression is usually a `reg' RTX for the hard
     register where the return value is stored.  The value can also be a
     `parallel' RTX, if the return value is in multiple places.  See
     `FUNCTION_ARG' for an explanation of the `parallel' form.

     If `PROMOTE_FUNCTION_RETURN' is defined, you must apply the same
     promotion rules specified in `PROMOTE_MODE' if VALTYPE is a scalar
     type.

     If the precise function being called is known, FUNC is a tree node
     (`FUNCTION_DECL') for it; otherwise, FUNC is a null pointer.  This
     makes it possible to use a different value-returning convention
     for specific functions when all their calls are known.

     `FUNCTION_VALUE' is not used for return vales with aggregate data
     types, because these are returned in another way.  See
     `STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM' and related macros, below.

`FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE (VALTYPE, FUNC)'
     Define this macro if the target machine has "register windows" so
     that the register in which a function returns its value is not the
     same as the one in which the caller sees the value.

     For such machines, `FUNCTION_VALUE' computes the register in which
     the caller will see the value.  `FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE' should be
     defined in a similar fashion to tell the function where to put the
     value.

     If `FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE' is not defined, `FUNCTION_VALUE'
     serves both purposes.

     `FUNCTION_OUTGOING_VALUE' is not used for return vales with
     aggregate data types, because these are returned in another way.
     See `STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM' and related macros, below.

`LIBCALL_VALUE (MODE)'
     A C expression to create an RTX representing the place where a
     library function returns a value of mode MODE.  If the precise
     function being called is known, FUNC is a tree node
     (`FUNCTION_DECL') for it; otherwise, FUNC is a null pointer.  This
     makes it possible to use a different value-returning convention
     for specific functions when all their calls are known.

     Note that "library function" in this context means a compiler
     support routine, used to perform arithmetic, whose name is known
     specially by the compiler and was not mentioned in the C code being
     compiled.

     The definition of `LIBRARY_VALUE' need not be concerned aggregate
     data types, because none of the library functions returns such
     types.

`FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P (REGNO)'
     A C expression that is nonzero if REGNO is the number of a hard
     register in which the values of called function may come back.

     A register whose use for returning values is limited to serving as
     the second of a pair (for a value of type `double', say) need not
     be recognized by this macro.  So for most machines, this definition
     suffices:

          #define FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P(N) ((N) == 0)

     If the machine has register windows, so that the caller and the
     called function use different registers for the return value, this
     macro should recognize only the caller's register numbers.

`APPLY_RESULT_SIZE'
     Define this macro if `untyped_call' and `untyped_return' need more
     space than is implied by `FUNCTION_VALUE_REGNO_P' for saving and
     restoring an arbitrary return value.

17.7.8 How Large Values Are Returned
------------------------------------

When a function value's mode is `BLKmode' (and in some other cases),
the value is not returned according to `FUNCTION_VALUE' (*note Scalar
Return::).  Instead, the caller passes the address of a block of memory
in which the value should be stored.  This address is called the
"structure value address".

   This section describes how to control returning structure values in
memory.

`RETURN_IN_MEMORY (TYPE)'
     A C expression which can inhibit the returning of certain function
     values in registers, based on the type of value.  A nonzero value
     says to return the function value in memory, just as large
     structures are always returned.  Here TYPE will be a C expression
     of type `tree', representing the data type of the value.

     Note that values of mode `BLKmode' must be explicitly handled by
     this macro.  Also, the option `-fpcc-struct-return' takes effect
     regardless of this macro.  On most systems, it is possible to
     leave the macro undefined; this causes a default definition to be
     used, whose value is the constant 1 for `BLKmode' values, and 0
     otherwise.

     Do not use this macro to indicate that structures and unions
     should always be returned in memory.  You should instead use
     `DEFAULT_PCC_STRUCT_RETURN' to indicate this.

`DEFAULT_PCC_STRUCT_RETURN'
     Define this macro to be 1 if all structure and union return values
     must be in memory.  Since this results in slower code, this should
     be defined only if needed for compatibility with other compilers
     or with an ABI.  If you define this macro to be 0, then the
     conventions used for structure and union return values are decided
     by the `RETURN_IN_MEMORY' macro.

     If not defined, this defaults to the value 1.

`STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM'
     If the structure value address is passed in a register, then
     `STRUCT_VALUE_REGNUM' should be the number of that register.

`STRUCT_VALUE'
     If the structure value address is not passed in a register, define
     `STRUCT_VALUE' as an expression returning an RTX for the place
     where the address is passed.  If it returns 0, the address is
     passed as an "invisible" first argument.

`STRUCT_VALUE_INCOMING_REGNUM'
     On some architectures the place where the structure value address
     is found by the called function is not the same place that the
     caller put it.  This can be due to register windows, or it could
     be because the function prologue moves it to a different place.

     If the incoming location of the structure value address is in a
     register, define this macro as the register number.

`STRUCT_VALUE_INCOMING'
     If the incoming location is not a register, then you should define
     `STRUCT_VALUE_INCOMING' as an expression for an RTX for where the
     called function should find the value.  If it should find the
     value on the stack, define this to create a `mem' which refers to
     the frame pointer.  A definition of 0 means that the address is
     passed as an "invisible" first argument.

`PCC_STATIC_STRUCT_RETURN'
     Define this macro if the usual system convention on the target
     machine for returning structures and unions is for the called
     function to return the address of a static variable containing the
     value.

     Do not define this if the usual system convention is for the
     caller to pass an address to the subroutine.

     This macro has effect in `-fpcc-struct-return' mode, but it does
     nothing when you use `-freg-struct-return' mode.

17.7.9 Caller-Saves Register Allocation
---------------------------------------

If you enable it, GNU CC can save registers around function calls.  This
makes it possible to use call-clobbered registers to hold variables that
must live across calls.

`DEFAULT_CALLER_SAVES'
     Define this macro if function calls on the target machine do not
     preserve any registers; in other words, if `CALL_USED_REGISTERS'
     has 1 for all registers.  When defined, this macro enables
     `-fcaller-saves' by default for all optimization levels.  It has
     no effect for optimization levels 2 and higher, where
     `-fcaller-saves' is the default.

`CALLER_SAVE_PROFITABLE (REFS, CALLS)'
     A C expression to determine whether it is worthwhile to consider
     placing a pseudo-register in a call-clobbered hard register and
     saving and restoring it around each function call.  The expression
     should be 1 when this is worth doing, and 0 otherwise.

     If you don't define this macro, a default is used which is good on
     most machines: `4 * CALLS < REFS'.

`HARD_REGNO_CALLER_SAVE_MODE (REGNO, NREGS)'
     A C expression specifying which mode is required for saving NREGS
     of a pseudo-register in call-clobbered hard register REGNO.  If
     REGNO is unsuitable for caller save, `VOIDmode' should be
     returned.  For most machines this macro need not be defined since
     GCC will select the smallest suitable mode.

17.7.10 Function Entry and Exit
-------------------------------

This section describes the macros that output function entry
("prologue") and exit ("epilogue") code.

`FUNCTION_PROLOGUE (FILE, SIZE)'
     A C compound statement that outputs the assembler code for entry
     to a function.  The prologue is responsible for setting up the
     stack frame, initializing the frame pointer register, saving
     registers that must be saved, and allocating SIZE additional bytes
     of storage for the local variables.  SIZE is an integer.  FILE is
     a stdio stream to which the assembler code should be output.

     The label for the beginning of the function need not be output by
     this macro.  That has already been done when the macro is run.

     To determine which registers to save, the macro can refer to the
     array `regs_ever_live': element R is nonzero if hard register R is
     used anywhere within the function.  This implies the function
     prologue should save register R, provided it is not one of the
     call-used registers.  (`FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must likewise use
     `regs_ever_live'.)

     On machines that have "register windows", the function entry code
     does not save on the stack the registers that are in the windows,
     even if they are supposed to be preserved by function calls;
     instead it takes appropriate steps to "push" the register stack,
     if any non-call-used registers are used in the function.

     On machines where functions may or may not have frame-pointers, the
     function entry code must vary accordingly; it must set up the frame
     pointer if one is wanted, and not otherwise.  To determine whether
     a frame pointer is in wanted, the macro can refer to the variable
     `frame_pointer_needed'.  The variable's value will be 1 at run
     time in a function that needs a frame pointer.  *Note
     Elimination::.

     The function entry code is responsible for allocating any stack
     space required for the function.  This stack space consists of the
     regions listed below.  In most cases, these regions are allocated
     in the order listed, with the last listed region closest to the
     top of the stack (the lowest address if `STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARD' is
     defined, and the highest address if it is not defined).  You can
     use a different order for a machine if doing so is more convenient
     or required for compatibility reasons.  Except in cases where
     required by standard or by a debugger, there is no reason why the
     stack layout used by GCC need agree with that used by other
     compilers for a machine.

        * A region of `current_function_pretend_args_size' bytes of
          uninitialized space just underneath the first argument
          arriving on the stack.  (This may not be at the very start of
          the allocated stack region if the calling sequence has pushed
          anything else since pushing the stack arguments.  But
          usually, on such machines, nothing else has been pushed yet,
          because the function prologue itself does all the pushing.)
          This region is used on machines where an argument may be
          passed partly in registers and partly in memory, and, in some
          cases to support the features in `varargs.h' and `stdargs.h'.

        * An area of memory used to save certain registers used by the
          function.  The size of this area, which may also include
          space for such things as the return address and pointers to
          previous stack frames, is machine-specific and usually
          depends on which registers have been used in the function.
          Machines with register windows often do not require a save
          area.

        * A region of at least SIZE bytes, possibly rounded up to an
          allocation boundary, to contain the local variables of the
          function.  On some machines, this region and the save area
          may occur in the opposite order, with the save area closer to
          the top of the stack.

        * Optionally, when `ACCUMULATE_OUTGOING_ARGS' is defined, a
          region of `current_function_outgoing_args_size' bytes to be
          used for outgoing argument lists of the function.  *Note
          Stack Arguments::.

     Normally, it is necessary for the macros `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and
     `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' to treat leaf functions specially.  The C
     variable `current_function_is_leaf' is nonzero for such a function.

`EXIT_IGNORE_STACK'
     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if the return
     instruction or the function epilogue ignores the value of the stack
     pointer; in other words, if it is safe to delete an instruction to
     adjust the stack pointer before a return from the function.

     Note that this macro's value is relevant only for functions for
     which frame pointers are maintained.  It is never safe to delete a
     final stack adjustment in a function that has no frame pointer,
     and the compiler knows this regardless of `EXIT_IGNORE_STACK'.

`EPILOGUE_USES (REGNO)'
     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero for registers
     are used by the epilogue or the `return' pattern.  The stack and
     frame pointer registers are already be assumed to be used as
     needed.

`FUNCTION_EPILOGUE (FILE, SIZE)'
     A C compound statement that outputs the assembler code for exit
     from a function.  The epilogue is responsible for restoring the
     saved registers and stack pointer to their values when the
     function was called, and returning control to the caller.  This
     macro takes the same arguments as the macro `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE',
     and the registers to restore are determined from `regs_ever_live'
     and `CALL_USED_REGISTERS' in the same way.

     On some machines, there is a single instruction that does all the
     work of returning from the function.  On these machines, give that
     instruction the name `return' and do not define the macro
     `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' at all.

     Do not define a pattern named `return' if you want the
     `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' to be used.  If you want the target switches
     to control whether return instructions or epilogues are used,
     define a `return' pattern with a validity condition that tests the
     target switches appropriately.  If the `return' pattern's validity
     condition is false, epilogues will be used.

     On machines where functions may or may not have frame-pointers, the
     function exit code must vary accordingly.  Sometimes the code for
     these two cases is completely different.  To determine whether a
     frame pointer is wanted, the macro can refer to the variable
     `frame_pointer_needed'.  The variable's value will be 1 when
     compiling a function that needs a frame pointer.

     Normally, `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must treat
     leaf functions specially.  The C variable
     `current_function_is_leaf' is nonzero for such a function.  *Note
     Leaf Functions::.

     On some machines, some functions pop their arguments on exit while
     others leave that for the caller to do.  For example, the 68020
     when given `-mrtd' pops arguments in functions that take a fixed
     number of arguments.

     Your definition of the macro `RETURN_POPS_ARGS' decides which
     functions pop their own arguments.  `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' needs to
     know what was decided.  The variable that is called
     `current_function_pops_args' is the number of bytes of its
     arguments that a function should pop.  *Note Scalar Return::.

`DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE'
     Define this macro if the function epilogue contains delay slots to
     which instructions from the rest of the function can be "moved".
     The definition should be a C expression whose value is an integer
     representing the number of delay slots there.

`ELIGIBLE_FOR_EPILOGUE_DELAY (INSN, N)'
     A C expression that returns 1 if INSN can be placed in delay slot
     number N of the epilogue.

     The argument N is an integer which identifies the delay slot now
     being considered (since different slots may have different rules of
     eligibility).  It is never negative and is always less than the
     number of epilogue delay slots (what `DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE'
     returns).  If you reject a particular insn for a given delay slot,
     in principle, it may be reconsidered for a subsequent delay slot.
     Also, other insns may (at least in principle) be considered for
     the so far unfilled delay slot.

     The insns accepted to fill the epilogue delay slots are put in an
     RTL list made with `insn_list' objects, stored in the variable
     `current_function_epilogue_delay_list'.  The insn for the first
     delay slot comes first in the list.  Your definition of the macro
     `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' should fill the delay slots by outputting the
     insns in this list, usually by calling `final_scan_insn'.

     You need not define this macro if you did not define
     `DELAY_SLOTS_FOR_EPILOGUE'.

`ASM_OUTPUT_MI_THUNK (FILE, THUNK_FNDECL, DELTA, FUNCTION)'
     A C compound statement that outputs the assembler code for a thunk
     function, used to implement C++ virtual function calls with
     multiple inheritance.  The thunk acts as a wrapper around a
     virtual function, adjusting the implicit object parameter before
     handing control off to the real function.

     First, emit code to add the integer DELTA to the location that
     contains the incoming first argument.  Assume that this argument
     contains a pointer, and is the one used to pass the `this' pointer
     in C++.  This is the incoming argument _before_ the function
     prologue, e.g. `%o0' on a sparc.  The addition must preserve the
     values of all other incoming arguments.

     After the addition, emit code to jump to FUNCTION, which is a
     `FUNCTION_DECL'.  This is a direct pure jump, not a call, and does
     not touch the return address.  Hence returning from FUNCTION will
     return to whoever called the current `thunk'.

     The effect must be as if FUNCTION had been called directly with
     the adjusted first argument.  This macro is responsible for
     emitting all of the code for a thunk function; `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE'
     and `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' are not invoked.

     The THUNK_FNDECL is redundant.  (DELTA and FUNCTION have already
     been extracted from it.)  It might possibly be useful on some
     targets, but probably not.

     If you do not define this macro, the target-independent code in
     the C++ frontend will generate a less efficient heavyweight thunk
     that calls FUNCTION instead of jumping to it.  The generic
     approach does not support varargs.

17.7.11 Generating Code for Profiling
-------------------------------------

These macros will help you generate code for profiling.

`FUNCTION_PROFILER (FILE, LABELNO)'
     A C statement or compound statement to output to FILE some
     assembler code to call the profiling subroutine `mcount'.  Before
     calling, the assembler code must load the address of a counter
     variable into a register where `mcount' expects to find the
     address.  The name of this variable is `LP' followed by the number
     LABELNO, so you would generate the name using `LP%d' in a
     `fprintf'.

     The details of how the address should be passed to `mcount' are
     determined by your operating system environment, not by GNU CC.  To
     figure them out, compile a small program for profiling using the
     system's installed C compiler and look at the assembler code that
     results.

`PROFILE_BEFORE_PROLOGUE'
     Define this macro if the code for function profiling should come
     before the function prologue.  Normally, the profiling code comes
     after.

`FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER (FILE, LABELNO)'
     A C statement or compound statement to output to FILE some
     assembler code to initialize basic-block profiling for the current
     object module.  The global compile flag `profile_block_flag'
     distinguishes two profile modes.

    `profile_block_flag != 2'
          Output code to call the subroutine `__bb_init_func' once per
          object module, passing it as its sole argument the address of
          a block allocated in the object module.

          The name of the block is a local symbol made with this
          statement:

               ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (BUFFER, "LPBX", 0);

          Of course, since you are writing the definition of
          `ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL' as well as that of this macro,
          you can take a short cut in the definition of this macro and
          use the name that you know will result.

          The first word of this block is a flag which will be nonzero
          if the object module has already been initialized.  So test
          this word first, and do not call `__bb_init_func' if the flag
          is nonzero.  BLOCK_OR_LABEL contains a unique number which
          may be used to generate a label as a branch destination when
          `__bb_init_func' will not be called.

          Described in assembler language, the code to be output looks
          like:

                 cmp (LPBX0),0
                 bne local_label
                 parameter1 <- LPBX0
                 call __bb_init_func
               local_label:

    `profile_block_flag == 2'
          Output code to call the subroutine `__bb_init_trace_func' and
          pass two parameters to it.  The first parameter is the same as
          for `__bb_init_func'.  The second parameter is the number of
          the first basic block of the function as given by
          BLOCK_OR_LABEL.  Note that `__bb_init_trace_func' has to be
          called, even if the object module has been initialized
          already.

          Described in assembler language, the code to be output looks
          like:
               parameter1 <- LPBX0
               parameter2 <- BLOCK_OR_LABEL
               call __bb_init_trace_func

`BLOCK_PROFILER (FILE, BLOCKNO)'
     A C statement or compound statement to output to FILE some
     assembler code to increment the count associated with the basic
     block number BLOCKNO.  The global compile flag
     `profile_block_flag' distinguishes two profile modes.

    `profile_block_flag != 2'
          Output code to increment the counter directly.  Basic blocks
          are numbered separately from zero within each compilation.
          The count associated with block number BLOCKNO is at index
          BLOCKNO in a vector of words; the name of this array is a
          local symbol made with this statement:

               ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (BUFFER, "LPBX", 2);

          Of course, since you are writing the definition of
          `ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL' as well as that of this macro,
          you can take a short cut in the definition of this macro and
          use the name that you know will result.

          Described in assembler language, the code to be output looks
          like:

               inc (LPBX2+4*BLOCKNO)

    `profile_block_flag == 2'
          Output code to initialize the global structure `__bb' and
          call the function `__bb_trace_func', which will increment the
          counter.

          `__bb' consists of two words.  In the first word, the current
          basic block number, as given by BLOCKNO, has to be stored.  In
          the second word, the address of a block allocated in the
          object module has to be stored.  The address is given by the
          label created with this statement:

               ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (BUFFER, "LPBX", 0);

          Described in assembler language, the code to be output looks
          like:
               move BLOCKNO -> (__bb)
               move LPBX0 -> (__bb+4)
               call __bb_trace_func

`FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER_EXIT (FILE)'
     A C statement or compound statement to output to FILE assembler
     code to call function `__bb_trace_ret'.  The assembler code should
     only be output if the global compile flag `profile_block_flag' ==
     2.  This macro has to be used at every place where code for
     returning from a function is generated (e.g. `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE').
     Although you have to write the definition of `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE'
     as well, you have to define this macro to tell the compiler, that
     the proper call to `__bb_trace_ret' is produced.

`MACHINE_STATE_SAVE (ID)'
     A C statement or compound statement to save all registers, which
     may be clobbered by a function call, including condition codes.
     The `asm' statement will be mostly likely needed to handle this
     task.  Local labels in the assembler code can be concatenated with
     the string ID, to obtain a unique lable name.

     Registers or condition codes clobbered by `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' or
     `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must be saved in the macros
     `FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER', `FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER_EXIT' and
     `BLOCK_PROFILER' prior calling `__bb_init_trace_func',
     `__bb_trace_ret' and `__bb_trace_func' respectively.

`MACHINE_STATE_RESTORE (ID)'
     A C statement or compound statement to restore all registers,
     including condition codes, saved by `MACHINE_STATE_SAVE'.

     Registers or condition codes clobbered by `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' or
     `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE' must be restored in the macros
     `FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER', `FUNCTION_BLOCK_PROFILER_EXIT' and
     `BLOCK_PROFILER' after calling `__bb_init_trace_func',
     `__bb_trace_ret' and `__bb_trace_func' respectively.

`BLOCK_PROFILER_CODE'
     A C function or functions which are needed in the library to
     support block profiling.

17.8 Implementing the Varargs Macros
====================================

GNU CC comes with an implementation of `varargs.h' and `stdarg.h' that
work without change on machines that pass arguments on the stack.
Other machines require their own implementations of varargs, and the
two machine independent header files must have conditionals to include
it.

   ANSI `stdarg.h' differs from traditional `varargs.h' mainly in the
calling convention for `va_start'.  The traditional implementation
takes just one argument, which is the variable in which to store the
argument pointer.  The ANSI implementation of `va_start' takes an
additional second argument.  The user is supposed to write the last
named argument of the function here.

   However, `va_start' should not use this argument.  The way to find
the end of the named arguments is with the built-in functions described
below.

`__builtin_saveregs ()'
     Use this built-in function to save the argument registers in
     memory so that the varargs mechanism can access them.  Both ANSI
     and traditional versions of `va_start' must use
     `__builtin_saveregs', unless you use `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' (see
     below) instead.

     On some machines, `__builtin_saveregs' is open-coded under the
     control of the macro `EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS'.  On other machines,
     it calls a routine written in assembler language, found in
     `libgcc2.c'.

     Code generated for the call to `__builtin_saveregs' appears at the
     beginning of the function, as opposed to where the call to
     `__builtin_saveregs' is written, regardless of what the code is.
     This is because the registers must be saved before the function
     starts to use them for its own purposes.

`__builtin_args_info (CATEGORY)'
     Use this built-in function to find the first anonymous arguments in
     registers.

     In general, a machine may have several categories of registers
     used for arguments, each for a particular category of data types.
     (For example, on some machines, floating-point registers are used
     for floating-point arguments while other arguments are passed in
     the general registers.)  To make non-varargs functions use the
     proper calling convention, you have defined the `CUMULATIVE_ARGS'
     data type to record how many registers in each category have been
     used so far

     `__builtin_args_info' accesses the same data structure of type
     `CUMULATIVE_ARGS' after the ordinary argument layout is finished
     with it, with CATEGORY specifying which word to access.  Thus, the
     value indicates the first unused register in a given category.

     Normally, you would use `__builtin_args_info' in the implementation
     of `va_start', accessing each category just once and storing the
     value in the `va_list' object.  This is because `va_list' will
     have to update the values, and there is no way to alter the values
     accessed by `__builtin_args_info'.

`__builtin_next_arg (LASTARG)'
     This is the equivalent of `__builtin_args_info', for stack
     arguments.  It returns the address of the first anonymous stack
     argument, as type `void *'. If `ARGS_GROW_DOWNWARD', it returns
     the address of the location above the first anonymous stack
     argument.  Use it in `va_start' to initialize the pointer for
     fetching arguments from the stack.  Also use it in `va_start' to
     verify that the second parameter LASTARG is the last named argument
     of the current function.

`__builtin_classify_type (OBJECT)'
     Since each machine has its own conventions for which data types are
     passed in which kind of register, your implementation of `va_arg'
     has to embody these conventions.  The easiest way to categorize the
     specified data type is to use `__builtin_classify_type' together
     with `sizeof' and `__alignof__'.

     `__builtin_classify_type' ignores the value of OBJECT, considering
     only its data type.  It returns an integer describing what kind of
     type that is--integer, floating, pointer, structure, and so on.

     The file `typeclass.h' defines an enumeration that you can use to
     interpret the values of `__builtin_classify_type'.

   These machine description macros help implement varargs:

`EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS (ARGS)'
     If defined, is a C expression that produces the machine-specific
     code for a call to `__builtin_saveregs'.  This code will be moved
     to the very beginning of the function, before any parameter access
     are made.  The return value of this function should be an RTX that
     contains the value to use as the return of `__builtin_saveregs'.

     The argument ARGS is a `tree_list' containing the arguments that
     were passed to `__builtin_saveregs'.

     If this macro is not defined, the compiler will output an ordinary
     call to the library function `__builtin_saveregs'.

`SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS (ARGS_SO_FAR, MODE, TYPE, PRETEND_ARGS_SIZE, SECOND_TIME)'
     This macro offers an alternative to using `__builtin_saveregs' and
     defining the macro `EXPAND_BUILTIN_SAVEREGS'.  Use it to store the
     anonymous register arguments into the stack so that all the
     arguments appear to have been passed consecutively on the stack.
     Once this is done, you can use the standard implementation of
     varargs that works for machines that pass all their arguments on
     the stack.

     The argument ARGS_SO_FAR is the `CUMULATIVE_ARGS' data structure,
     containing the values that obtain after processing of the named
     arguments.  The arguments MODE and TYPE describe the last named
     argument--its machine mode and its data type as a tree node.

     The macro implementation should do two things: first, push onto the
     stack all the argument registers _not_ used for the named
     arguments, and second, store the size of the data thus pushed into
     the `int'-valued variable whose name is supplied as the argument
     PRETEND_ARGS_SIZE.  The value that you store here will serve as
     additional offset for setting up the stack frame.

     Because you must generate code to push the anonymous arguments at
     compile time without knowing their data types,
     `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' is only useful on machines that have just
     a single category of argument register and use it uniformly for
     all data types.

     If the argument SECOND_TIME is nonzero, it means that the
     arguments of the function are being analyzed for the second time.
     This happens for an inline function, which is not actually
     compiled until the end of the source file.  The macro
     `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' should not generate any instructions in
     this case.

`STRICT_ARGUMENT_NAMING'
     Define this macro to be a nonzero value if the location where a
     function argument is passed depends on whether or not it is a
     named argument.

     This macro controls how the NAMED argument to `FUNCTION_ARG' is
     set for varargs and stdarg functions.  If this macro returns a
     nonzero value, the NAMED argument is always true for named
     arguments, and false for unnamed arguments.  If it returns a value
     of zero, but `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' is defined, then all
     arguments are treated as named.  Otherwise, all named arguments
     except the last are treated as named.

     You need not define this macro if it always returns zero.

`PRETEND_OUTGOING_VARARGS_NAMED'
     If you need to conditionally change ABIs so that one works with
     `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS', but the other works like neither
     `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' nor `STRICT_ARGUMENT_NAMING' was defined,
     then define this macro to return nonzero if
     `SETUP_INCOMING_VARARGS' is used, zero otherwise.  Otherwise, you
     should not define this macro.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Trampolines,  Next: Library Calls,  Prev: Varargs,  Up: Target Macros

17.9 Trampolines for Nested Functions
=====================================

A "trampoline" is a small piece of code that is created at run time
when the address of a nested function is taken.  It normally resides on
the stack, in the stack frame of the containing function.  These macros
tell GNU CC how to generate code to allocate and initialize a
trampoline.

   The instructions in the trampoline must do two things: load a
constant address into the static chain register, and jump to the real
address of the nested function.  On CISC machines such as the m68k,
this requires two instructions, a move immediate and a jump.  Then the
two addresses exist in the trampoline as word-long immediate operands.
On RISC machines, it is often necessary to load each address into a
register in two parts.  Then pieces of each address form separate
immediate operands.

   The code generated to initialize the trampoline must store the
variable parts--the static chain value and the function address--into
the immediate operands of the instructions.  On a CISC machine, this is
simply a matter of copying each address to a memory reference at the
proper offset from the start of the trampoline.  On a RISC machine, it
may be necessary to take out pieces of the address and store them
separately.

`TRAMPOLINE_TEMPLATE (FILE)'
     A C statement to output, on the stream FILE, assembler code for a
     block of data that contains the constant parts of a trampoline.
     This code should not include a label--the label is taken care of
     automatically.

     If you do not define this macro, it means no template is needed
     for the target.  Do not define this macro on systems where the
     block move code to copy the trampoline into place would be larger
     than the code to generate it on the spot.

`TRAMPOLINE_SECTION'
     The name of a subroutine to switch to the section in which the
     trampoline template is to be placed (*note Sections::).  The
     default is a value of `readonly_data_section', which places the
     trampoline in the section containing read-only data.

`TRAMPOLINE_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size in bytes of the trampoline, as an
     integer.

`TRAMPOLINE_ALIGNMENT'
     Alignment required for trampolines, in bits.

     If you don't define this macro, the value of `BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT'
     is used for aligning trampolines.

`INITIALIZE_TRAMPOLINE (ADDR, FNADDR, STATIC_CHAIN)'
     A C statement to initialize the variable parts of a trampoline.
     ADDR is an RTX for the address of the trampoline; FNADDR is an RTX
     for the address of the nested function; STATIC_CHAIN is an RTX for
     the static chain value that should be passed to the function when
     it is called.

`ALLOCATE_TRAMPOLINE (FP)'
     A C expression to allocate run-time space for a trampoline.  The
     expression value should be an RTX representing a memory reference
     to the space for the trampoline.

     If this macro is not defined, by default the trampoline is
     allocated as a stack slot.  This default is right for most
     machines.  The exceptions are machines where it is impossible to
     execute instructions in the stack area.  On such machines, you may
     have to implement a separate stack, using this macro in
     conjunction with `FUNCTION_PROLOGUE' and `FUNCTION_EPILOGUE'.

     FP points to a data structure, a `struct function', which
     describes the compilation status of the immediate containing
     function of the function which the trampoline is for.  Normally
     (when `ALLOCATE_TRAMPOLINE' is not defined), the stack slot for the
     trampoline is in the stack frame of this containing function.
     Other allocation strategies probably must do something analogous
     with this information.

   Implementing trampolines is difficult on many machines because they
have separate instruction and data caches.  Writing into a stack
location fails to clear the memory in the instruction cache, so when
the program jumps to that location, it executes the old contents.

   Here are two possible solutions.  One is to clear the relevant parts
of the instruction cache whenever a trampoline is set up.  The other is
to make all trampolines identical, by having them jump to a standard
subroutine.  The former technique makes trampoline execution faster; the
latter makes initialization faster.

   To clear the instruction cache when a trampoline is initialized,
define the following macros which describe the shape of the cache.

`INSN_CACHE_SIZE'
     The total size in bytes of the cache.

`INSN_CACHE_LINE_WIDTH'
     The length in bytes of each cache line.  The cache is divided into
     cache lines which are disjoint slots, each holding a contiguous
     chunk of data fetched from memory.  Each time data is brought into
     the cache, an entire line is read at once.  The data loaded into a
     cache line is always aligned on a boundary equal to the line size.

`INSN_CACHE_DEPTH'
     The number of alternative cache lines that can hold any particular
     memory location.

   Alternatively, if the machine has system calls or instructions to
clear the instruction cache directly, you can define the following
macro.

`CLEAR_INSN_CACHE (BEG, END)'
     If defined, expands to a C expression clearing the _instruction
     cache_ in the specified interval.  If it is not defined, and the
     macro INSN_CACHE_SIZE is defined, some generic code is generated
     to clear the cache.  The definition of this macro would typically
     be a series of `asm' statements.  Both BEG and END are both pointer
     expressions.

   To use a standard subroutine, define the following macro.  In
addition, you must make sure that the instructions in a trampoline fill
an entire cache line with identical instructions, or else ensure that
the beginning of the trampoline code is always aligned at the same
point in its cache line.  Look in `m68k.h' as a guide.

`TRANSFER_FROM_TRAMPOLINE'
     Define this macro if trampolines need a special subroutine to do
     their work.  The macro should expand to a series of `asm'
     statements which will be compiled with GNU CC.  They go in a
     library function named `__transfer_from_trampoline'.

     If you need to avoid executing the ordinary prologue code of a
     compiled C function when you jump to the subroutine, you can do so
     by placing a special label of your own in the assembler code.  Use
     one `asm' statement to generate an assembler label, and another to
     make the label global.  Then trampolines can use that label to
     jump directly to your special assembler code.

17.10 Implicit Calls to Library Routines
========================================

Here is an explanation of implicit calls to library routines.

`MULSI3_LIBCALL'
     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for
     multiplication of one signed full-word by another.  If you do not
     define this macro, the default name is used, which is `__mulsi3',
     a function defined in `libgcc.a'.

`DIVSI3_LIBCALL'
     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for
     division of one signed full-word by another.  If you do not define
     this macro, the default name is used, which is `__divsi3', a
     function defined in `libgcc.a'.

`UDIVSI3_LIBCALL'
     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for
     division of one unsigned full-word by another.  If you do not
     define this macro, the default name is used, which is `__udivsi3',
     a function defined in `libgcc.a'.

`MODSI3_LIBCALL'
     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for the
     remainder in division of one signed full-word by another.  If you
     do not define this macro, the default name is used, which is
     `__modsi3', a function defined in `libgcc.a'.

`UMODSI3_LIBCALL'
     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for the
     remainder in division of one unsigned full-word by another.  If
     you do not define this macro, the default name is used, which is
     `__umodsi3', a function defined in `libgcc.a'.

`MULDI3_LIBCALL'
     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for
     multiplication of one signed double-word by another.  If you do not
     define this macro, the default name is used, which is `__muldi3',
     a function defined in `libgcc.a'.

`DIVDI3_LIBCALL'
     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for
     division of one signed double-word by another.  If you do not
     define this macro, the default name is used, which is `__divdi3', a
     function defined in `libgcc.a'.

`UDIVDI3_LIBCALL'
     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for
     division of one unsigned full-word by another.  If you do not
     define this macro, the default name is used, which is `__udivdi3',
     a function defined in `libgcc.a'.

`MODDI3_LIBCALL'
     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for the
     remainder in division of one signed double-word by another.  If
     you do not define this macro, the default name is used, which is
     `__moddi3', a function defined in `libgcc.a'.

`UMODDI3_LIBCALL'
     A C string constant giving the name of the function to call for the
     remainder in division of one unsigned full-word by another.  If
     you do not define this macro, the default name is used, which is
     `__umoddi3', a function defined in `libgcc.a'.

`INIT_TARGET_OPTABS'
     Define this macro as a C statement that declares additional library
     routines renames existing ones. `init_optabs' calls this macro
     after initializing all the normal library routines.

`TARGET_EDOM'
     The value of `EDOM' on the target machine, as a C integer constant
     expression.  If you don't define this macro, GNU CC does not
     attempt to deposit the value of `EDOM' into `errno' directly.
     Look in `/usr/include/errno.h' to find the value of `EDOM' on your
     system.

     If you do not define `TARGET_EDOM', then compiled code reports
     domain errors by calling the library function and letting it
     report the error.  If mathematical functions on your system use
     `matherr' when there is an error, then you should leave
     `TARGET_EDOM' undefined so that `matherr' is used normally.

`GEN_ERRNO_RTX'
     Define this macro as a C expression to create an rtl expression
     that refers to the global "variable" `errno'.  (On certain systems,
     `errno' may not actually be a variable.)  If you don't define this
     macro, a reasonable default is used.

`TARGET_MEM_FUNCTIONS'
     Define this macro if GNU CC should generate calls to the System V
     (and ANSI C) library functions `memcpy' and `memset' rather than
     the BSD functions `bcopy' and `bzero'.

`LIBGCC_NEEDS_DOUBLE'
     Define this macro if only `float' arguments cannot be passed to
     library routines (so they must be converted to `double').  This
     macro affects both how library calls are generated and how the
     library routines in `libgcc1.c' accept their arguments.  It is
     useful on machines where floating and fixed point arguments are
     passed differently, such as the i860.

`FLOAT_ARG_TYPE'
     Define this macro to override the type used by the library
     routines to pick up arguments of type `float'.  (By default, they
     use a union of `float' and `int'.)

     The obvious choice would be `float'--but that won't work with
     traditional C compilers that expect all arguments declared as
     `float' to arrive as `double'.  To avoid this conversion, the
     library routines ask for the value as some other type and then
     treat it as a `float'.

     On some systems, no other type will work for this.  For these
     systems, you must use `LIBGCC_NEEDS_DOUBLE' instead, to force
     conversion of the values `double' before they are passed.

`FLOATIFY (PASSED-VALUE)'
     Define this macro to override the way library routines redesignate
     a `float' argument as a `float' instead of the type it was passed
     as.  The default is an expression which takes the `float' field of
     the union.

`FLOAT_VALUE_TYPE'
     Define this macro to override the type used by the library
     routines to return values that ought to have type `float'.  (By
     default, they use `int'.)

     The obvious choice would be `float'--but that won't work with
     traditional C compilers gratuitously convert values declared as
     `float' into `double'.

`INTIFY (FLOAT-VALUE)'
     Define this macro to override the way the value of a
     `float'-returning library routine should be packaged in order to
     return it.  These functions are actually declared to return type
     `FLOAT_VALUE_TYPE' (normally `int').

     These values can't be returned as type `float' because traditional
     C compilers would gratuitously convert the value to a `double'.

     A local variable named `intify' is always available when the macro
     `INTIFY' is used.  It is a union of a `float' field named `f' and
     a field named `i' whose type is `FLOAT_VALUE_TYPE' or `int'.

     If you don't define this macro, the default definition works by
     copying the value through that union.

`nongcc_SI_type'
     Define this macro as the name of the data type corresponding to
     `SImode' in the system's own C compiler.

     You need not define this macro if that type is `long int', as it
     usually is.

`nongcc_word_type'
     Define this macro as the name of the data type corresponding to the
     word_mode in the system's own C compiler.

     You need not define this macro if that type is `long int', as it
     usually is.

`perform_...'
     Define these macros to supply explicit C statements to carry out
     various arithmetic operations on types `float' and `double' in the
     library routines in `libgcc1.c'.  See that file for a full list of
     these macros and their arguments.

     On most machines, you don't need to define any of these macros,
     because the C compiler that comes with the system takes care of
     doing them.

`NEXT_OBJC_RUNTIME'
     Define this macro to generate code for Objective C message sending
     using the calling convention of the NeXT system.  This calling
     convention involves passing the object, the selector and the
     method arguments all at once to the method-lookup library function.

     The default calling convention passes just the object and the
     selector to the lookup function, which returns a pointer to the
     method.

17.11 Addressing Modes
======================

This is about addressing modes.

`HAVE_POST_INCREMENT'
     A C expression that is nonzero the machine supports post-increment
     addressing.

`HAVE_PRE_INCREMENT'
`HAVE_POST_DECREMENT'
`HAVE_PRE_DECREMENT'
     Similar for other kinds of addressing.

`CONSTANT_ADDRESS_P (X)'
     A C expression that is 1 if the RTX X is a constant which is a
     valid address.  On most machines, this can be defined as
     `CONSTANT_P (X)', but a few machines are more restrictive in which
     constant addresses are supported.

     `CONSTANT_P' accepts integer-values expressions whose values are
     not explicitly known, such as `symbol_ref', `label_ref', and
     `high' expressions and `const' arithmetic expressions, in addition
     to `const_int' and `const_double' expressions.

`MAX_REGS_PER_ADDRESS'
     A number, the maximum number of registers that can appear in a
     valid memory address.  Note that it is up to you to specify a
     value equal to the maximum number that `GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS'
     would ever accept.

`GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS (MODE, X, LABEL)'
     A C compound statement with a conditional `goto LABEL;' executed
     if X (an RTX) is a legitimate memory address on the target machine
     for a memory operand of mode MODE.

     It usually pays to define several simpler macros to serve as
     subroutines for this one.  Otherwise it may be too complicated to
     understand.

     This macro must exist in two variants: a strict variant and a
     non-strict one.  The strict variant is used in the reload pass.  It
     must be defined so that any pseudo-register that has not been
     allocated a hard register is considered a memory reference.  In
     contexts where some kind of register is required, a pseudo-register
     with no hard register must be rejected.

     The non-strict variant is used in other passes.  It must be
     defined to accept all pseudo-registers in every context where some
     kind of register is required.

     Compiler source files that want to use the strict variant of this
     macro define the macro `REG_OK_STRICT'.  You should use an `#ifdef
     REG_OK_STRICT' conditional to define the strict variant in that
     case and the non-strict variant otherwise.

     Subroutines to check for acceptable registers for various purposes
     (one for base registers, one for index registers, and so on) are
     typically among the subroutines used to define
     `GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS'.  Then only these subroutine macros
     need have two variants; the higher levels of macros may be the
     same whether strict or not.

     Normally, constant addresses which are the sum of a `symbol_ref'
     and an integer are stored inside a `const' RTX to mark them as
     constant.  Therefore, there is no need to recognize such sums
     specifically as legitimate addresses.  Normally you would simply
     recognize any `const' as legitimate.

     Usually `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS' is not prepared to handle constant
     sums that are not marked with  `const'.  It assumes that a naked
     `plus' indicates indexing.  If so, then you _must_ reject such
     naked constant sums as illegitimate addresses, so that none of
     them will be given to `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS'.

     On some machines, whether a symbolic address is legitimate depends
     on the section that the address refers to.  On these machines,
     define the macro `ENCODE_SECTION_INFO' to store the information
     into the `symbol_ref', and then check for it here.  When you see a
     `const', you will have to look inside it to find the `symbol_ref'
     in order to determine the section.  *Note Assembler Format::.

     The best way to modify the name string is by adding text to the
     beginning, with suitable punctuation to prevent any ambiguity.
     Allocate the new name in `saveable_obstack'.  You will have to
     modify `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' to remove and decode the added text
     and output the name accordingly, and define `STRIP_NAME_ENCODING'
     to access the original name string.

     You can check the information stored here into the `symbol_ref' in
     the definitions of the macros `GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS' and
     `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS'.

`REG_OK_FOR_BASE_P (X)'
     A C expression that is nonzero if X (assumed to be a `reg' RTX) is
     valid for use as a base register.  For hard registers, it should
     always accept those which the hardware permits and reject the
     others.  Whether the macro accepts or rejects pseudo registers
     must be controlled by `REG_OK_STRICT' as described above.  This
     usually requires two variant definitions, of which `REG_OK_STRICT'
     controls the one actually used.

`REG_MODE_OK_FOR_BASE_P (X, MODE)'
     A C expression that is just like `REG_OK_FOR_BASE_P', except that
     that expression may examine the mode of the memory reference in
     MODE.  You should define this macro if the mode of the memory
     reference affects whether a register may be used as a base
     register.  If you define this macro, the compiler will use it
     instead of `REG_OK_FOR_BASE_P'.

`REG_OK_FOR_INDEX_P (X)'
     A C expression that is nonzero if X (assumed to be a `reg' RTX) is
     valid for use as an index register.

     The difference between an index register and a base register is
     that the index register may be scaled.  If an address involves the
     sum of two registers, neither one of them scaled, then either one
     may be labeled the "base" and the other the "index"; but whichever
     labeling is used must fit the machine's constraints of which
     registers may serve in each capacity.  The compiler will try both
     labelings, looking for one that is valid, and will reload one or
     both registers only if neither labeling works.

`LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS (X, OLDX, MODE, WIN)'
     A C compound statement that attempts to replace X with a valid
     memory address for an operand of mode MODE.  WIN will be a C
     statement label elsewhere in the code; the macro definition may use

          GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS (MODE, X, WIN);

     to avoid further processing if the address has become legitimate.

     X will always be the result of a call to `break_out_memory_refs',
     and OLDX will be the operand that was given to that function to
     produce X.

     The code generated by this macro should not alter the substructure
     of X.  If it transforms X into a more legitimate form, it should
     assign X (which will always be a C variable) a new value.

     It is not necessary for this macro to come up with a legitimate
     address.  The compiler has standard ways of doing so in all cases.
     In fact, it is safe for this macro to do nothing.  But often a
     machine-dependent strategy can generate better code.

`LEGITIMIZE_RELOAD_ADDRESS (X, MODE, OPNUM, TYPE, IND_LEVELS, WIN)'
     A C compound statement that attempts to replace X, which is an
     address that needs reloading, with a valid memory address for an
     operand of mode MODE.  WIN will be a C statement label elsewhere
     in the code.  It is not necessary to define this macro, but it
     might be useful for performance reasons.

     For example, on the i386, it is sometimes possible to use a single
     reload register instead of two by reloading a sum of two pseudo
     registers into a register.  On the other hand, for number of RISC
     processors offsets are limited so that often an intermediate
     address needs to be generated in order to address a stack slot.
     By defining LEGITIMIZE_RELOAD_ADDRESS appropriately, the
     intermediate addresses generated for adjacent some stack slots can
     be made identical, and thus be shared.

     _Note_: This macro should be used with caution.  It is necessary
     to know something of how reload works in order to effectively use
     this, and it is quite easy to produce macros that build in too
     much knowledge of reload internals.

     _Note_: This macro must be able to reload an address created by a
     previous invocation of this macro.  If it fails to handle such
     addresses then the compiler may generate incorrect code or abort.

     The macro definition should use `push_reload' to indicate parts
     that need reloading; OPNUM, TYPE and IND_LEVELS are usually
     suitable to be passed unaltered to `push_reload'.

     The code generated by this macro must not alter the substructure of
     X.  If it transforms X into a more legitimate form, it should
     assign X (which will always be a C variable) a new value.  This
     also applies to parts that you change indirectly by calling
     `push_reload'.

     The macro definition may use `strict_memory_address_p' to test if
     the address has become legitimate.

     If you want to change only a part of X, one standard way of doing
     this is to use `copy_rtx'.  Note, however, that is unshares only a
     single level of rtl.  Thus, if the part to be changed is not at the
     top level, you'll need to replace first the top leve It is not
     necessary for this macro to come up with a legitimate address;
     but often a machine-dependent strategy can generate better code.

`GO_IF_MODE_DEPENDENT_ADDRESS (ADDR, LABEL)'
     A C statement or compound statement with a conditional `goto
     LABEL;' executed if memory address X (an RTX) can have different
     meanings depending on the machine mode of the memory reference it
     is used for or if the address is valid for some modes but not
     others.

     Autoincrement and autodecrement addresses typically have
     mode-dependent effects because the amount of the increment or
     decrement is the size of the operand being addressed.  Some
     machines have other mode-dependent addresses.  Many RISC machines
     have no mode-dependent addresses.

     You may assume that ADDR is a valid address for the machine.

`LEGITIMATE_CONSTANT_P (X)'
     A C expression that is nonzero if X is a legitimate constant for
     an immediate operand on the target machine.  You can assume that X
     satisfies `CONSTANT_P', so you need not check this.  In fact, `1'
     is a suitable definition for this macro on machines where anything
     `CONSTANT_P' is valid.

17.12 Condition Code Status
===========================

This describes the condition code status.

   The file `conditions.h' defines a variable `cc_status' to describe
how the condition code was computed (in case the interpretation of the
condition code depends on the instruction that it was set by).  This
variable contains the RTL expressions on which the condition code is
currently based, and several standard flags.

   Sometimes additional machine-specific flags must be defined in the
machine description header file.  It can also add additional
machine-specific information by defining `CC_STATUS_MDEP'.

`CC_STATUS_MDEP'
     C code for a data type which is used for declaring the `mdep'
     component of `cc_status'.  It defaults to `int'.

     This macro is not used on machines that do not use `cc0'.

`CC_STATUS_MDEP_INIT'
     A C expression to initialize the `mdep' field to "empty".  The
     default definition does nothing, since most machines don't use the
     field anyway.  If you want to use the field, you should probably
     define this macro to initialize it.

     This macro is not used on machines that do not use `cc0'.

`NOTICE_UPDATE_CC (EXP, INSN)'
     A C compound statement to set the components of `cc_status'
     appropriately for an insn INSN whose body is EXP.  It is this
     macro's responsibility to recognize insns that set the condition
     code as a byproduct of other activity as well as those that
     explicitly set `(cc0)'.

     This macro is not used on machines that do not use `cc0'.

     If there are insns that do not set the condition code but do alter
     other machine registers, this macro must check to see whether they
     invalidate the expressions that the condition code is recorded as
     reflecting.  For example, on the 68000, insns that store in address
     registers do not set the condition code, which means that usually
     `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' can leave `cc_status' unaltered for such insns.
     But suppose that the previous insn set the condition code based on
     location `a4@(102)' and the current insn stores a new value in
     `a4'.  Although the condition code is not changed by this, it will
     no longer be true that it reflects the contents of `a4@(102)'.
     Therefore, `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' must alter `cc_status' in this case
     to say that nothing is known about the condition code value.

     The definition of `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' must be prepared to deal with
     the results of peephole optimization: insns whose patterns are
     `parallel' RTXs containing various `reg', `mem' or constants which
     are just the operands.  The RTL structure of these insns is not
     sufficient to indicate what the insns actually do.  What
     `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' should do when it sees one is just to run
     `CC_STATUS_INIT'.

     A possible definition of `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC' is to call a function
     that looks at an attribute (*note Insn Attributes::) named, for
     example, `cc'.  This avoids having detailed information about
     patterns in two places, the `md' file and in `NOTICE_UPDATE_CC'.

`EXTRA_CC_MODES'
     A list of names to be used for additional modes for condition code
     values in registers (*note Jump Patterns::).  These names are added
     to `enum machine_mode' and all have class `MODE_CC'.  By
     convention, they should start with `CC' and end with `mode'.

     You should only define this macro if your machine does not use
     `cc0' and only if additional modes are required.

`EXTRA_CC_NAMES'
     A list of C strings giving the names for the modes listed in
     `EXTRA_CC_MODES'.  For example, the Sparc defines this macro and
     `EXTRA_CC_MODES' as

          #define EXTRA_CC_MODES CC_NOOVmode, CCFPmode, CCFPEmode
          #define EXTRA_CC_NAMES "CC_NOOV", "CCFP", "CCFPE"

     This macro is not required if `EXTRA_CC_MODES' is not defined.

`SELECT_CC_MODE (OP, X, Y)'
     Returns a mode from class `MODE_CC' to be used when comparison
     operation code OP is applied to rtx X and Y.  For example, on the
     Sparc, `SELECT_CC_MODE' is defined as (see *note Jump Patterns::
     for a description of the reason for this definition)

          #define SELECT_CC_MODE(OP,X,Y) \
            (GET_MODE_CLASS (GET_MODE (X)) == MODE_FLOAT          \
             ? ((OP == EQ || OP == NE) ? CCFPmode : CCFPEmode)    \
             : ((GET_CODE (X) == PLUS || GET_CODE (X) == MINUS    \
                 || GET_CODE (X) == NEG) \
                ? CC_NOOVmode : CCmode))

     You need not define this macro if `EXTRA_CC_MODES' is not defined.

`CANONICALIZE_COMPARISON (CODE, OP0, OP1)'
     One some machines not all possible comparisons are defined, but
     you can convert an invalid comparison into a valid one.  For
     example, the Alpha does not have a `GT' comparison, but you can
     use an `LT' comparison instead and swap the order of the operands.

     On such machines, define this macro to be a C statement to do any
     required conversions.  CODE is the initial comparison code and OP0
     and OP1 are the left and right operands of the comparison,
     respectively.  You should modify CODE, OP0, and OP1 as required.

     GNU CC will not assume that the comparison resulting from this
     macro is valid but will see if the resulting insn matches a
     pattern in the `md' file.

     You need not define this macro if it would never change the
     comparison code or operands.

`REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE (MODE)'
     A C expression whose value is one if it is always safe to reverse a
     comparison whose mode is MODE.  If `SELECT_CC_MODE' can ever
     return MODE for a floating-point inequality comparison, then
     `REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE (MODE)' must be zero.

     You need not define this macro if it would always returns zero or
     if the floating-point format is anything other than
     `IEEE_FLOAT_FORMAT'.  For example, here is the definition used on
     the Sparc, where floating-point inequality comparisons are always
     given `CCFPEmode':

          #define REVERSIBLE_CC_MODE(MODE)  ((MODE) != CCFPEmode)

17.13 Describing Relative Costs of Operations
=============================================

These macros let you describe the relative speed of various operations
on the target machine.

`CONST_COSTS (X, CODE, OUTER_CODE)'
     A part of a C `switch' statement that describes the relative costs
     of constant RTL expressions.  It must contain `case' labels for
     expression codes `const_int', `const', `symbol_ref', `label_ref'
     and `const_double'.  Each case must ultimately reach a `return'
     statement to return the relative cost of the use of that kind of
     constant value in an expression.  The cost may depend on the
     precise value of the constant, which is available for examination
     in X, and the rtx code of the expression in which it is contained,
     found in OUTER_CODE.

     CODE is the expression code--redundant, since it can be obtained
     with `GET_CODE (X)'.

`RTX_COSTS (X, CODE, OUTER_CODE)'
     Like `CONST_COSTS' but applies to nonconstant RTL expressions.
     This can be used, for example, to indicate how costly a multiply
     instruction is.  In writing this macro, you can use the construct
     `COSTS_N_INSNS (N)' to specify a cost equal to N fast
     instructions.  OUTER_CODE is the code of the expression in which X
     is contained.

     This macro is optional; do not define it if the default cost
     assumptions are adequate for the target machine.

`DEFAULT_RTX_COSTS (X, CODE, OUTER_CODE)'
     This macro, if defined, is called for any case not handled by the
     `RTX_COSTS' or `CONST_COSTS' macros.  This eliminates the need to
     put case labels into the macro, but the code, or any functions it
     calls, must assume that the RTL in X could be of any type that has
     not already been handled.  The arguments are the same as for
     `RTX_COSTS', and the macro should execute a return statement giving
     the cost of any RTL expressions that it can handle.  The default
     cost calculation is used for any RTL for which this macro does not
     return a value.

     This macro is optional; do not define it if the default cost
     assumptions are adequate for the target machine.

`ADDRESS_COST (ADDRESS)'
     An expression giving the cost of an addressing mode that contains
     ADDRESS.  If not defined, the cost is computed from the ADDRESS
     expression and the `CONST_COSTS' values.

     For most CISC machines, the default cost is a good approximation
     of the true cost of the addressing mode.  However, on RISC
     machines, all instructions normally have the same length and
     execution time.  Hence all addresses will have equal costs.

     In cases where more than one form of an address is known, the form
     with the lowest cost will be used.  If multiple forms have the
     same, lowest, cost, the one that is the most complex will be used.

     For example, suppose an address that is equal to the sum of a
     register and a constant is used twice in the same basic block.
     When this macro is not defined, the address will be computed in a
     register and memory references will be indirect through that
     register.  On machines where the cost of the addressing mode
     containing the sum is no higher than that of a simple indirect
     reference, this will produce an additional instruction and
     possibly require an additional register.  Proper specification of
     this macro eliminates this overhead for such machines.

     Similar use of this macro is made in strength reduction of loops.

     ADDRESS need not be valid as an address.  In such a case, the cost
     is not relevant and can be any value; invalid addresses need not be
     assigned a different cost.

     On machines where an address involving more than one register is as
     cheap as an address computation involving only one register,
     defining `ADDRESS_COST' to reflect this can cause two registers to
     be live over a region of code where only one would have been if
     `ADDRESS_COST' were not defined in that manner.  This effect should
     be considered in the definition of this macro.  Equivalent costs
     should probably only be given to addresses with different numbers
     of registers on machines with lots of registers.

     This macro will normally either not be defined or be defined as a
     constant.

`REGISTER_MOVE_COST (FROM, TO)'
     A C expression for the cost of moving data from a register in class
     FROM to one in class TO.  The classes are expressed using the
     enumeration values such as `GENERAL_REGS'.  A value of 2 is the
     default; other values are interpreted relative to that.

     It is not required that the cost always equal 2 when FROM is the
     same as TO; on some machines it is expensive to move between
     registers if they are not general registers.

     If reload sees an insn consisting of a single `set' between two
     hard registers, and if `REGISTER_MOVE_COST' applied to their
     classes returns a value of 2, reload does not check to ensure that
     the constraints of the insn are met.  Setting a cost of other than
     2 will allow reload to verify that the constraints are met.  You
     should do this if the `movM' pattern's constraints do not allow
     such copying.

`MEMORY_MOVE_COST (MODE, CLASS, IN)'
     A C expression for the cost of moving data of mode MODE between a
     register of class CLASS and memory; IN is zero if the value is to
     be written to memory, non-zero if it is to be read in.  This cost
     is relative to those in `REGISTER_MOVE_COST'.  If moving between
     registers and memory is more expensive than between two registers,
     you should define this macro to express the relative cost.

     If you do not define this macro, GNU CC uses a default cost of 4
     plus the cost of copying via a secondary reload register, if one is
     needed.  If your machine requires a secondary reload register to
     copy between memory and a register of CLASS but the reload
     mechanism is more complex than copying via an intermediate, define
     this macro to reflect the actual cost of the move.

     GNU CC defines the function `memory_move_secondary_cost' if
     secondary reloads are needed.  It computes the costs due to
     copying via a secondary register.  If your machine copies from
     memory using a secondary register in the conventional way but the
     default base value of 4 is not correct for your machine, define
     this macro to add some other value to the result of that function.
     The arguments to that function are the same as to this macro.

`BRANCH_COST'
     A C expression for the cost of a branch instruction.  A value of 1
     is the default; other values are interpreted relative to that.

   Here are additional macros which do not specify precise relative
costs, but only that certain actions are more expensive than GNU CC
would ordinarily expect.

`SLOW_BYTE_ACCESS'
     Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if accessing
     less than a word of memory (i.e. a `char' or a `short') is no
     faster than accessing a word of memory, i.e., if such access
     require more than one instruction or if there is no difference in
     cost between byte and (aligned) word loads.

     When this macro is not defined, the compiler will access a field by
     finding the smallest containing object; when it is defined, a
     fullword load will be used if alignment permits.  Unless bytes
     accesses are faster than word accesses, using word accesses is
     preferable since it may eliminate subsequent memory access if
     subsequent accesses occur to other fields in the same word of the
     structure, but to different bytes.

`SLOW_ZERO_EXTEND'
     Define this macro if zero-extension (of a `char' or `short' to an
     `int') can be done faster if the destination is a register that is
     known to be zero.

     If you define this macro, you must have instruction patterns that
     recognize RTL structures like this:

          (set (strict_low_part (subreg:QI (reg:SI ...) 0)) ...)

     and likewise for `HImode'.

`SLOW_UNALIGNED_ACCESS'
     Define this macro to be the value 1 if unaligned accesses have a
     cost many times greater than aligned accesses, for example if they
     are emulated in a trap handler.

     When this macro is non-zero, the compiler will act as if
     `STRICT_ALIGNMENT' were non-zero when generating code for block
     moves.  This can cause significantly more instructions to be
     produced.  Therefore, do not set this macro non-zero if unaligned
     accesses only add a cycle or two to the time for a memory access.

     If the value of this macro is always zero, it need not be defined.

`DONT_REDUCE_ADDR'
     Define this macro to inhibit strength reduction of memory
     addresses.  (On some machines, such strength reduction seems to do
     harm rather than good.)

`MOVE_RATIO'
     The threshold of number of scalar memory-to-memory move insns,
     _below_ which a sequence of insns  should be generated instead of a
     string move insn or a library call.  Increasing the value will
     always make code faster, but eventually incurs high cost in
     increased code size.

     Note that on machines with no memory-to-memory move insns, this
     macro denotes the corresponding number of memory-to-memory
     _sequences_.

     If you don't define this, a reasonable default is used.

`MOVE_BY_PIECES_P (SIZE, ALIGNMENT)'
     A C expression used to determine whether `move_by_pieces' will be
     used to copy a chunk of memory, or whether some other block move
     mechanism will be used.  Defaults to 1 if `move_by_pieces_ninsns'
     returns less than `MOVE_RATIO'.

`MOVE_MAX_PIECES'
     A C expression used by `move_by_pieces' to determine the largest
     unit a load or store used to copy memory is.  Defaults to
     `MOVE_MAX'.

`USE_LOAD_POST_INCREMENT (MODE)'
     A C expression used to determine whether a load postincrement is a
     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     `HAVE_POST_INCREMENT'.

`USE_LOAD_POST_DECREMENT (MODE)'
     A C expression used to determine whether a load postdecrement is a
     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     `HAVE_POST_DECREMENT'.

`USE_LOAD_PRE_INCREMENT (MODE)'
     A C expression used to determine whether a load preincrement is a
     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     `HAVE_PRE_INCREMENT'.

`USE_LOAD_PRE_DECREMENT (MODE)'
     A C expression used to determine whether a load predecrement is a
     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     `HAVE_PRE_DECREMENT'.

`USE_STORE_POST_INCREMENT (MODE)'
     A C expression used to determine whether a store postincrement is
     a good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     `HAVE_POST_INCREMENT'.

`USE_STORE_POST_DECREMENT (MODE)'
     A C expression used to determine whether a store postdeccrement is
     a good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     `HAVE_POST_DECREMENT'.

`USE_STORE_PRE_INCREMENT (MODE)'
     This macro is used to determine whether a store preincrement is a
     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     `HAVE_PRE_INCREMENT'.

`USE_STORE_PRE_DECREMENT (MODE)'
     This macro is used to determine whether a store predecrement is a
     good thing to use for a given mode.  Defaults to the value of
     `HAVE_PRE_DECREMENT'.

`NO_FUNCTION_CSE'
     Define this macro if it is as good or better to call a constant
     function address than to call an address kept in a register.

`NO_RECURSIVE_FUNCTION_CSE'
     Define this macro if it is as good or better for a function to call
     itself with an explicit address than to call an address kept in a
     register.

`ADJUST_COST (INSN, LINK, DEP_INSN, COST)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to update the integer variable COST
     based on the relationship between INSN that is dependent on
     DEP_INSN through the dependence LINK.  The default is to make no
     adjustment to COST.  This can be used for example to specify to
     the scheduler that an output- or anti-dependence does not incur
     the same cost as a data-dependence.

`ADJUST_PRIORITY (INSN)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to update the integer scheduling
     priority `INSN_PRIORITY(INSN)'.  Reduce the priority to execute
     the INSN earlier, increase the priority to execute INSN later.
     Do not define this macro if you do not need to adjust the
     scheduling priorities of insns.

17.14 Dividing the Output into Sections (Texts, Data, ...)
==========================================================

An object file is divided into sections containing different types of
data.  In the most common case, there are three sections: the "text
section", which holds instructions and read-only data; the "data
section", which holds initialized writable data; and the "bss section",
which holds uninitialized data.  Some systems have other kinds of
sections.

   The compiler must tell the assembler when to switch sections.  These
macros control what commands to output to tell the assembler this.  You
can also define additional sections.

`TEXT_SECTION_ASM_OP'
     A C expression whose value is a string containing the assembler
     operation that should precede instructions and read-only data.
     Normally `".text"' is right.

`DATA_SECTION_ASM_OP'
     A C expression whose value is a string containing the assembler
     operation to identify the following data as writable initialized
     data.  Normally `".data"' is right.

`SHARED_SECTION_ASM_OP'
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string containing the
     assembler operation to identify the following data as shared data.
     If not defined, `DATA_SECTION_ASM_OP' will be used.

`BSS_SECTION_ASM_OP'
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string containing the
     assembler operation to identify the following data as
     uninitialized global data.  If not defined, and neither
     `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS' nor `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_BSS' are defined,
     uninitialized global data will be output in the data section if
     `-fno-common' is passed, otherwise `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' will be
     used.

`SHARED_BSS_SECTION_ASM_OP'
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string containing the
     assembler operation to identify the following data as
     uninitialized global shared data.  If not defined, and
     `BSS_SECTION_ASM_OP' is, the latter will be used.

`INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP'
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string containing the
     assembler operation to identify the following data as
     initialization code.  If not defined, GNU CC will assume such a
     section does not exist.

`EXTRA_SECTIONS'
     A list of names for sections other than the standard two, which are
     `in_text' and `in_data'.  You need not define this macro on a
     system with no other sections (that GCC needs to use).

`EXTRA_SECTION_FUNCTIONS'
     One or more functions to be defined in `varasm.c'.  These
     functions should do jobs analogous to those of `text_section' and
     `data_section', for your additional sections.  Do not define this
     macro if you do not define `EXTRA_SECTIONS'.

`READONLY_DATA_SECTION'
     On most machines, read-only variables, constants, and jump tables
     are placed in the text section.  If this is not the case on your
     machine, this macro should be defined to be the name of a function
     (either `data_section' or a function defined in `EXTRA_SECTIONS')
     that switches to the section to be used for read-only items.

     If these items should be placed in the text section, this macro
     should not be defined.

`SELECT_SECTION (EXP, RELOC)'
     A C statement or statements to switch to the appropriate section
     for output of EXP.  You can assume that EXP is either a `VAR_DECL'
     node or a constant of some sort.  RELOC indicates whether the
     initial value of EXP requires link-time relocations.  Select the
     section by calling `text_section' or one of the alternatives for
     other sections.

     Do not define this macro if you put all read-only variables and
     constants in the read-only data section (usually the text section).

`SELECT_RTX_SECTION (MODE, RTX)'
     A C statement or statements to switch to the appropriate section
     for output of RTX in mode MODE.  You can assume that RTX is some
     kind of constant in RTL.  The argument MODE is redundant except in
     the case of a `const_int' rtx.  Select the section by calling
     `text_section' or one of the alternatives for other sections.

     Do not define this macro if you put all constants in the read-only
     data section.

`JUMP_TABLES_IN_TEXT_SECTION'
     Define this macro to be an expression with a non-zero value if jump
     tables (for `tablejump' insns) should be output in the text
     section, along with the assembler instructions.  Otherwise, the
     readonly data section is used.

     This macro is irrelevant if there is no separate readonly data
     section.

`ENCODE_SECTION_INFO (DECL)'
     Define this macro if references to a symbol must be treated
     differently depending on something about the variable or function
     named by the symbol (such as what section it is in).

     The macro definition, if any, is executed immediately after the
     rtl for DECL has been created and stored in `DECL_RTL (DECL)'.
     The value of the rtl will be a `mem' whose address is a
     `symbol_ref'.

     The usual thing for this macro to do is to record a flag in the
     `symbol_ref' (such as `SYMBOL_REF_FLAG') or to store a modified
     name string in the `symbol_ref' (if one bit is not enough
     information).

`STRIP_NAME_ENCODING (VAR, SYM_NAME)'
     Decode SYM_NAME and store the real name part in VAR, sans the
     characters that encode section info.  Define this macro if
     `ENCODE_SECTION_INFO' alters the symbol's name string.

`UNIQUE_SECTION_P (DECL)'
     A C expression which evaluates to true if DECL should be placed
     into a unique section for some target-specific reason.  If you do
     not define this macro, the default is `0'.  Note that the flag
     `-ffunction-sections' will also cause functions to be placed into
     unique sections.

`UNIQUE_SECTION (DECL, RELOC)'
     A C statement to build up a unique section name, expressed as a
     STRING_CST node, and assign it to `DECL_SECTION_NAME (DECL)'.
     RELOC indicates whether the initial value of EXP requires
     link-time relocations.  If you do not define this macro, GNU CC
     will use the symbol name prefixed by `.' as the section name.

17.15 Position Independent Code
===============================

This section describes macros that help implement generation of position
independent code.  Simply defining these macros is not enough to
generate valid PIC; you must also add support to the macros
`GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS' and `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS', as well as
`LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS'.  You must modify the definition of `movsi' to do
something appropriate when the source operand contains a symbolic
address.  You may also need to alter the handling of switch statements
so that they use relative addresses.

`PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM'
     The register number of the register used to address a table of
     static data addresses in memory.  In some cases this register is
     defined by a processor's "application binary interface" (ABI).
     When this macro is defined, RTL is generated for this register
     once, as with the stack pointer and frame pointer registers.  If
     this macro is not defined, it is up to the machine-dependent files
     to allocate such a register (if necessary).

`PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REG_CALL_CLOBBERED'
     Define this macro if the register defined by
     `PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM' is clobbered by calls.  Do not define
     this macro if `PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM' is not defined.

`FINALIZE_PIC'
     By generating position-independent code, when two different
     programs (A and B) share a common library (libC.a), the text of
     the library can be shared whether or not the library is linked at
     the same address for both programs.  In some of these
     environments, position-independent code requires not only the use
     of different addressing modes, but also special code to enable the
     use of these addressing modes.

     The `FINALIZE_PIC' macro serves as a hook to emit these special
     codes once the function is being compiled into assembly code, but
     not before.  (It is not done before, because in the case of
     compiling an inline function, it would lead to multiple PIC
     prologues being included in functions which used inline functions
     and were compiled to assembly language.)

`LEGITIMATE_PIC_OPERAND_P (X)'
     A C expression that is nonzero if X is a legitimate immediate
     operand on the target machine when generating position independent
     code.  You can assume that X satisfies `CONSTANT_P', so you need
     not check this.  You can also assume FLAG_PIC is true, so you need
     not check it either.  You need not define this macro if all
     constants (including `SYMBOL_REF') can be immediate operands when
     generating position independent code.

17.16.1 The Overall Framework of an Assembler File
--------------------------------------------------

This describes the overall framework of an assembler file.

`ASM_FILE_START (STREAM)'
     A C expression which outputs to the stdio stream STREAM some
     appropriate text to go at the start of an assembler file.

     Normally this macro is defined to output a line containing
     `#NO_APP', which is a comment that has no effect on most
     assemblers but tells the GNU assembler that it can save time by not
     checking for certain assembler constructs.

     On systems that use SDB, it is necessary to output certain
     commands; see `attasm.h'.

`ASM_FILE_END (STREAM)'
     A C expression which outputs to the stdio stream STREAM some
     appropriate text to go at the end of an assembler file.

     If this macro is not defined, the default is to output nothing
     special at the end of the file.  Most systems don't require any
     definition.

     On systems that use SDB, it is necessary to output certain
     commands; see `attasm.h'.

`ASM_IDENTIFY_GCC (FILE)'
     A C statement to output assembler commands which will identify the
     object file as having been compiled with GNU CC (or another GNU
     compiler).

     If you don't define this macro, the string `gcc_compiled.:' is
     output.  This string is calculated to define a symbol which, on
     BSD systems, will never be defined for any other reason.  GDB
     checks for the presence of this symbol when reading the symbol
     table of an executable.

     On non-BSD systems, you must arrange communication with GDB in
     some other fashion.  If GDB is not used on your system, you can
     define this macro with an empty body.

`ASM_COMMENT_START'
     A C string constant describing how to begin a comment in the target
     assembler language.  The compiler assumes that the comment will
     end at the end of the line.

`ASM_APP_ON'
     A C string constant for text to be output before each `asm'
     statement or group of consecutive ones.  Normally this is
     `"#APP"', which is a comment that has no effect on most assemblers
     but tells the GNU assembler that it must check the lines that
     follow for all valid assembler constructs.

`ASM_APP_OFF'
     A C string constant for text to be output after each `asm'
     statement or group of consecutive ones.  Normally this is
     `"#NO_APP"', which tells the GNU assembler to resume making the
     time-saving assumptions that are valid for ordinary compiler
     output.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_FILENAME (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement to output COFF information or DWARF debugging
     information which indicates that filename NAME is the current
     source file to the stdio stream STREAM.

     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output for
     the file format in use is appropriate.

`OUTPUT_QUOTED_STRING (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement to output the string STRING to the stdio stream
     STREAM.  If you do not call the function `output_quoted_string' in
     your config files, GNU CC will only call it to output filenames to
     the assembler source.  So you can use it to canonicalize the format
     of the filename using this macro.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_LINE (STREAM, LINE)'
     A C statement to output DBX or SDB debugging information before
     code for line number LINE of the current source file to the stdio
     stream STREAM.

     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of debugging
     information for the debugger in use is appropriate.

`ASM_OUTPUT_IDENT (STREAM, STRING)'
     A C statement to output something to the assembler file to handle a
     `#ident' directive containing the text STRING.  If this macro is
     not defined, nothing is output for a `#ident' directive.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SECTION_NAME (STREAM, DECL, NAME, RELOC)'
     A C statement to output something to the assembler file to switch
     to section NAME for object DECL which is either a `FUNCTION_DECL',
     a `VAR_DECL' or `NULL_TREE'.  RELOC indicates whether the initial
     value of EXP requires link-time relocations.  Some target formats
     do not support arbitrary sections.  Do not define this macro in
     such cases.

     At present this macro is only used to support section attributes.
     When this macro is undefined, section attributes are disabled.

`OBJC_PROLOGUE'
     A C statement to output any assembler statements which are
     required to precede any Objective C object definitions or message
     sending.  The statement is executed only when compiling an
     Objective C program.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Data Output,  Next: Uninitialized Data,  Prev: File Framework,  Up: Assembler Format

17.16.2 Output of Data
----------------------

This describes data output.

`ASM_OUTPUT_LONG_DOUBLE (STREAM, VALUE)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_DOUBLE (STREAM, VALUE)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_FLOAT (STREAM, VALUE)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_THREE_QUARTER_FLOAT (STREAM, VALUE)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_SHORT_FLOAT (STREAM, VALUE)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_BYTE_FLOAT (STREAM, VALUE)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to assemble a floating-point constant of `TFmode',
     `DFmode', `SFmode', `TQFmode', `HFmode', or `QFmode',
     respectively, whose value is VALUE.  VALUE will be a C expression
     of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.  Macros such as
     `REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DOUBLE' are useful for writing these
     definitions.

`ASM_OUTPUT_QUADRUPLE_INT (STREAM, EXP)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_DOUBLE_INT (STREAM, EXP)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_INT (STREAM, EXP)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_SHORT (STREAM, EXP)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_CHAR (STREAM, EXP)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to assemble an integer of 16, 8, 4, 2 or 1 bytes,
     respectively, whose value is VALUE.  The argument EXP will be an
     RTL expression which represents a constant value.  Use
     `output_addr_const (STREAM, EXP)' to output this value as an
     assembler expression.

     For sizes larger than `UNITS_PER_WORD', if the action of a macro
     would be identical to repeatedly calling the macro corresponding to
     a size of `UNITS_PER_WORD', once for each word, you need not define
     the macro.

`ASM_OUTPUT_BYTE (STREAM, VALUE)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to assemble a single byte containing the number VALUE.

`ASM_BYTE_OP'
     A C string constant giving the pseudo-op to use for a sequence of
     single-byte constants.  If this macro is not defined, the default
     is `"byte"'.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ASCII (STREAM, PTR, LEN)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to assemble a string constant containing the LEN bytes
     at PTR.  PTR will be a C expression of type `char *' and LEN a C
     expression of type `int'.

     If the assembler has a `.ascii' pseudo-op as found in the Berkeley
     Unix assembler, do not define the macro `ASM_OUTPUT_ASCII'.

`CONSTANT_POOL_BEFORE_FUNCTION'
     You may define this macro as a C expression.  You should define the
     expression to have a non-zero value if GNU CC should output the
     constant pool for a function before the code for the function, or
     a zero value if GNU CC should output the constant pool after the
     function.  If you do not define this macro, the usual case, GNU CC
     will output the constant pool before the function.

`ASM_OUTPUT_POOL_PROLOGUE (FILE FUNNAME FUNDECL SIZE)'
     A C statement to output assembler commands to define the start of
     the constant pool for a function.  FUNNAME is a string giving the
     name of the function.  Should the return type of the function be
     required, it can be obtained via FUNDECL.  SIZE is the size, in
     bytes, of the constant pool that will be written immediately after
     this call.

     If no constant-pool prefix is required, the usual case, this macro
     need not be defined.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SPECIAL_POOL_ENTRY (FILE, X, MODE, ALIGN, LABELNO, JUMPTO)'
     A C statement (with or without semicolon) to output a constant in
     the constant pool, if it needs special treatment.  (This macro
     need not do anything for RTL expressions that can be output
     normally.)

     The argument FILE is the standard I/O stream to output the
     assembler code on.  X is the RTL expression for the constant to
     output, and MODE is the machine mode (in case X is a `const_int').
     ALIGN is the required alignment for the value X; you should output
     an assembler directive to force this much alignment.

     The argument LABELNO is a number to use in an internal label for
     the address of this pool entry.  The definition of this macro is
     responsible for outputting the label definition at the proper
     place.  Here is how to do this:

          ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL (FILE, "LC", LABELNO);

     When you output a pool entry specially, you should end with a
     `goto' to the label JUMPTO.  This will prevent the same pool entry
     from being output a second time in the usual manner.

     You need not define this macro if it would do nothing.

`CONSTANT_AFTER_FUNCTION_P (EXP)'
     Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if the
     constant EXP, of type `tree', should be output after the code for a
     function.  The compiler will normally output all constants before
     the function; you need not define this macro if this is OK.

`ASM_OUTPUT_POOL_EPILOGUE (FILE FUNNAME FUNDECL SIZE)'
     A C statement to output assembler commands to at the end of the
     constant pool for a function.  FUNNAME is a string giving the name
     of the function.  Should the return type of the function be
     required, you can obtain it via FUNDECL.  SIZE is the size, in
     bytes, of the constant pool that GNU CC wrote immediately before
     this call.

     If no constant-pool epilogue is required, the usual case, you need
     not define this macro.

`IS_ASM_LOGICAL_LINE_SEPARATOR (C)'
     Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if C is used
     as a logical line separator by the assembler.

     If you do not define this macro, the default is that only the
     character `;' is treated as a logical line separator.

`ASM_OPEN_PAREN'
`ASM_CLOSE_PAREN'
     These macros are defined as C string constant, describing the
     syntax in the assembler for grouping arithmetic expressions.  The
     following definitions are correct for most assemblers:

          #define ASM_OPEN_PAREN "("
          #define ASM_CLOSE_PAREN ")"

   These macros are provided by `real.h' for writing the definitions of
`ASM_OUTPUT_DOUBLE' and the like:

`REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_SINGLE (X, L)'
`REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DOUBLE (X, L)'
`REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_LONG_DOUBLE (X, L)'
     These translate X, of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE', to the target's
     floating point representation, and store its bit pattern in the
     array of `long int' whose address is L.  The number of elements in
     the output array is determined by the size of the desired target
     floating point data type: 32 bits of it go in each `long int' array
     element.  Each array element holds 32 bits of the result, even if
     `long int' is wider than 32 bits on the host machine.

     The array element values are designed so that you can print them
     out using `fprintf' in the order they should appear in the target
     machine's memory.

`REAL_VALUE_TO_DECIMAL (X, FORMAT, STRING)'
     This macro converts X, of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE', to a decimal
     number and stores it as a string into STRING.  You must pass, as
     STRING, the address of a long enough block of space to hold the
     result.

     The argument FORMAT is a `printf'-specification that serves as a
     suggestion for how to format the output string.

17.16.3 Output of Uninitialized Variables
-----------------------------------------

Each of the macros in this section is used to do the whole job of
outputting a single uninitialized variable.

`ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM the assembler definition of a common-label named NAME whose
     size is SIZE bytes.  The variable ROUNDED is the size rounded up
     to whatever alignment the caller wants.

     Use the expression `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the
     name itself; before and after that, output the additional
     assembler syntax for defining the name, and a newline.

     This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized
     common global variables are output.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)'
     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' except takes the required alignment as a
     separate, explicit argument.  If you define this macro, it is used
     in place of `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON', and gives you more flexibility in
     handling the required alignment of the variable.  The alignment is
     specified as the number of bits.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL_COMMON (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)'
     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON' except that DECL of the variable
     to be output, if there is one, or `NULL_TREE' if there is not
     corresponding variable.  If you define this macro, GNU CC wil use
     it in place of both `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' and
     `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON'.  Define this macro when you need to
     see the variable's decl in order to chose what to output.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SHARED_COMMON (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
     If defined, it is similar to `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON', except that it
     is used when NAME is shared.  If not defined, `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON'
     will be used.

`ASM_OUTPUT_BSS (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM the assembler definition of uninitialized global DECL named
     NAME whose size is SIZE bytes.  The variable ROUNDED is the size
     rounded up to whatever alignment the caller wants.

     Try to use function `asm_output_bss' defined in `varasm.c' when
     defining this macro.  If unable, use the expression `assemble_name
     (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name itself; before and after that,
     output the additional assembler syntax for defining the name, and
     a newline.

     This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized
     global variables are output.  This macro exists to properly
     support languages like `c++' which do not have `common' data.
     However, this macro currently is not defined for all targets.  If
     this macro and `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_BSS' are not defined then
     `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' or `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON' or
     `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL_COMMON' is used.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_BSS (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)'
     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS' except takes the required alignment as a
     separate, explicit argument.  If you define this macro, it is used
     in place of `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS', and gives you more flexibility in
     handling the required alignment of the variable.  The alignment is
     specified as the number of bits.

     Try to use function `asm_output_aligned_bss' defined in file
     `varasm.c' when defining this macro.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SHARED_BSS (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
     If defined, it is similar to `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS', except that it is
     used when NAME is shared.  If not defined, `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS' will
     be used.

`ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM the assembler definition of a local-common-label named NAME
     whose size is SIZE bytes.  The variable ROUNDED is the size
     rounded up to whatever alignment the caller wants.

     Use the expression `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the
     name itself; before and after that, output the additional
     assembler syntax for defining the name, and a newline.

     This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized
     static variables are output.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_LOCAL (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)'
     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL' except takes the required alignment as a
     separate, explicit argument.  If you define this macro, it is used
     in place of `ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL', and gives you more flexibility in
     handling the required alignment of the variable.  The alignment is
     specified as the number of bits.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL_LOCAL (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)'
     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL' except that DECL of the variable to
     be output, if there is one, or `NULL_TREE' if there is not
     corresponding variable.  If you define this macro, GNU CC wil use
     it in place of both `ASM_OUTPUT_DECL' and
     `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL'.  Define this macro when you need to see
     the variable's decl in order to chose what to output.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SHARED_LOCAL (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
     If defined, it is similar to `ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL', except that it is
     used when NAME is shared.  If not defined, `ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL' will
     be used.

17.16.4 Output and Generation of Labels
---------------------------------------

This is about outputting labels.

`ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM the assembler definition of a label named NAME.  Use the
     expression `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name
     itself; before and after that, output the additional assembler
     syntax for defining the name, and a newline.

`ASM_DECLARE_FUNCTION_NAME (STREAM, NAME, DECL)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the name NAME of a
     function which is being defined.  This macro is responsible for
     outputting the label definition (perhaps using
     `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').  The argument DECL is the `FUNCTION_DECL'
     tree node representing the function.

     If this macro is not defined, then the function name is defined in
     the usual manner as a label (by means of `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').

`ASM_DECLARE_FUNCTION_SIZE (STREAM, NAME, DECL)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the size of a function
     which is being defined.  The argument NAME is the name of the
     function.  The argument DECL is the `FUNCTION_DECL' tree node
     representing the function.

     If this macro is not defined, then the function size is not
     defined.

`ASM_DECLARE_OBJECT_NAME (STREAM, NAME, DECL)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the name NAME of an
     initialized variable which is being defined.  This macro must
     output the label definition (perhaps using `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').
     The argument DECL is the `VAR_DECL' tree node representing the
     variable.

     If this macro is not defined, then the variable name is defined in
     the usual manner as a label (by means of `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').

`ASM_FINISH_DECLARE_OBJECT (STREAM, DECL, TOPLEVEL, ATEND)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to finish up declaring a variable
     name once the compiler has processed its initializer fully and
     thus has had a chance to determine the size of an array when
     controlled by an initializer.  This is used on systems where it's
     necessary to declare something about the size of the object.

     If you don't define this macro, that is equivalent to defining it
     to do nothing.

`ASM_GLOBALIZE_LABEL (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM some commands that will make the label NAME global; that
     is, available for reference from other files.  Use the expression
     `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name itself; before
     and after that, output the additional assembler syntax for making
     that name global, and a newline.

`ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM some commands that will make the label NAME weak; that is,
     available for reference from other files but only used if no other
     definition is available.  Use the expression `assemble_name
     (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name itself; before and after that,
     output the additional assembler syntax for making that name weak,
     and a newline.

     If you don't define this macro, GNU CC will not support weak
     symbols and you should not define the `SUPPORTS_WEAK' macro.

`SUPPORTS_WEAK'
     A C expression which evaluates to true if the target supports weak
     symbols.

     If you don't define this macro, `defaults.h' provides a default
     definition.  If `ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL' is defined, the default
     definition is `1'; otherwise, it is `0'.  Define this macro if you
     want to control weak symbol support with a compiler flag such as
     `-melf'.

`MAKE_DECL_ONE_ONLY'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to mark DECL to be emitted as a
     public symbol such that extra copies in multiple translation units
     will be discarded by the linker.  Define this macro if your object
     file format provides support for this concept, such as the `COMDAT'
     section flags in the Microsoft Windows PE/COFF format, and this
     support requires changes to DECL, such as putting it in a separate
     section.

`SUPPORTS_ONE_ONLY'
     A C expression which evaluates to true if the target supports
     one-only semantics.

     If you don't define this macro, `varasm.c' provides a default
     definition.  If `MAKE_DECL_ONE_ONLY' is defined, the default
     definition is `1'; otherwise, it is `0'.  Define this macro if you
     want to control one-only symbol support with a compiler flag, or if
     setting the `DECL_ONE_ONLY' flag is enough to mark a declaration to
     be emitted as one-only.

`ASM_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL (STREAM, DECL, NAME)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the name of an external
     symbol named NAME which is referenced in this compilation but not
     defined.  The value of DECL is the tree node for the declaration.

     This macro need not be defined if it does not need to output
     anything.  The GNU assembler and most Unix assemblers don't
     require anything.

`ASM_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL_LIBCALL (STREAM, SYMREF)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output on STREAM an assembler
     pseudo-op to declare a library function name external.  The name
     of the library function is given by SYMREF, which has type `rtx'
     and is a `symbol_ref'.

     This macro need not be defined if it does not need to output
     anything.  The GNU assembler and most Unix assemblers don't
     require anything.

`ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM a reference in assembler syntax to a label named NAME.
     This should add `_' to the front of the name, if that is customary
     on your operating system, as it is in most Berkeley Unix systems.
     This macro is used in `assemble_name'.

`ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL (STREAM, PREFIX, NUM)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM a label whose
     name is made from the string PREFIX and the number NUM.

     It is absolutely essential that these labels be distinct from the
     labels used for user-level functions and variables.  Otherwise,
     certain programs will have name conflicts with internal labels.

     It is desirable to exclude internal labels from the symbol table
     of the object file.  Most assemblers have a naming convention for
     labels that should be excluded; on many systems, the letter `L' at
     the beginning of a label has this effect.  You should find out what
     convention your system uses, and follow it.

     The usual definition of this macro is as follows:

          fprintf (STREAM, "L%s%d:\n", PREFIX, NUM)

`ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (STRING, PREFIX, NUM)'
     A C statement to store into the string STRING a label whose name
     is made from the string PREFIX and the number NUM.

     This string, when output subsequently by `assemble_name', should
     produce the output that `ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL' would produce
     with the same PREFIX and NUM.

     If the string begins with `*', then `assemble_name' will output
     the rest of the string unchanged.  It is often convenient for
     `ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL' to use `*' in this way.  If the
     string doesn't start with `*', then `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' gets to
     output the string, and may change it.  (Of course,
     `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' is also part of your machine description, so
     you should know what it does on your machine.)

`ASM_FORMAT_PRIVATE_NAME (OUTVAR, NAME, NUMBER)'
     A C expression to assign to OUTVAR (which is a variable of type
     `char *') a newly allocated string made from the string NAME and
     the number NUMBER, with some suitable punctuation added.  Use
     `alloca' to get space for the string.

     The string will be used as an argument to `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' to
     produce an assembler label for an internal static variable whose
     name is NAME.  Therefore, the string must be such as to result in
     valid assembler code.  The argument NUMBER is different each time
     this macro is executed; it prevents conflicts between
     similarly-named internal static variables in different scopes.

     Ideally this string should not be a valid C identifier, to prevent
     any conflict with the user's own symbols.  Most assemblers allow
     periods or percent signs in assembler symbols; putting at least
     one of these between the name and the number will suffice.

`ASM_OUTPUT_DEF (STREAM, NAME, VALUE)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM assembler code
     which defines (equates) the symbol NAME to have the value VALUE.

     If SET_ASM_OP is defined, a default definition is provided which is
     correct for most systems.

`ASM_OUTPUT_DEFINE_LABEL_DIFFERENCE_SYMBOL (STREAM, SYMBOL, HIGH, LOW)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM assembler code
     which defines (equates) the symbol SYMBOL to have a value equal to
     the difference of the two symbols HIGH and LOW, i.e.  HIGH minus
     LOW.  GNU CC guarantees that the symbols HIGH and LOW are already
     known by the assembler so that the difference resolves into a
     constant.

     If SET_ASM_OP is defined, a default definition is provided which is
     correct for most systems.

`ASM_OUTPUT_WEAK_ALIAS (STREAM, NAME, VALUE)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM assembler code
     which defines (equates) the weak symbol NAME to have the value
     VALUE.

     Define this macro if the target only supports weak aliases; define
     ASM_OUTPUT_DEF instead if possible.

`OBJC_GEN_METHOD_LABEL (BUF, IS_INST, CLASS_NAME, CAT_NAME, SEL_NAME)'
     Define this macro to override the default assembler names used for
     Objective C methods.

     The default name is a unique method number followed by the name of
     the class (e.g. `_1_Foo').  For methods in categories, the name of
     the category is also included in the assembler name (e.g.
     `_1_Foo_Bar').

     These names are safe on most systems, but make debugging difficult
     since the method's selector is not present in the name.
     Therefore, particular systems define other ways of computing names.

     BUF is an expression of type `char *' which gives you a buffer in
     which to store the name; its length is as long as CLASS_NAME,
     CAT_NAME and SEL_NAME put together, plus 50 characters extra.

     The argument IS_INST specifies whether the method is an instance
     method or a class method; CLASS_NAME is the name of the class;
     CAT_NAME is the name of the category (or NULL if the method is not
     in a category); and SEL_NAME is the name of the selector.

     On systems where the assembler can handle quoted names, you can
     use this macro to provide more human-readable names.
